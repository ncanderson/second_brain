## Completed Tasks
- Managed to get some db inserts working
## Ongoing Tasks
- Standing up the database

## Tasks for Tomorrow
- Figure out if I can get away with treating GUIDs like strings for a postgres insert.

## Blockers
- Issues with using `boost::uuids::uid`, seems like I may need to add support for a new data type which involves some meta-programming that's tough for me.

## Accomplishments
