## Completed Tasks
- How to push a docker image
- managed to build a postgres .run. Not 100% sure if it works.

## Ongoing Tasks
Packaging up the [[postgresql dev notes]] dependencies for inclusion in the project

## Tasks for Tomorrow
- Confirm the postgres .run works as expected

## Blockers
- Still can't build docker containers locally, which will be important if I have to build them and push them up manually.
- We'll have to determine how to build the seco pcs *and* the software that will go onto the Mio in the same Jenkins run.
