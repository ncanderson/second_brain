## Tasks for Tomorrow
remote vs. local install targets
- The buoy target would display the video streams locally, so there's only one workspace on the buoy, and one on the remote. 

- I think that the local target should have no workspace, but would need to trigger the autostart script via the desktop icon.
	- The .desktop will call `killall` then call the `local `autostart script.
- Then execute the killall script in `start_workspace_buoy`
