## Completed Tasks
- Spoke to David Pearson about WAMV stuff

## Ongoing Tasks
Trying to get lcm tunnel work. Changing the lcm tunnel stat channel names tunnel URLs seems to have fixed the looping behavior, but I still can't change the profile for some reason.

`gss_lcm_tunnel` - only the most recently enabled profile is working, so something is acting weird with how comms manager is arbitrating the LCM traffic.

We only seem to be getting LCM from one lcm tunnel instance. 
## Tasks for Tomorrow
Address the profile switching for comms manager

## Blockers
