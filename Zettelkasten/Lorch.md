# Lorch
![[glinmaleldur_lorch_owner_of_a_medieval_tavern_a9cd0686-853a-4fc9-82f9-f3d0cf3704a2.png]]

**Personality:** Kind, but with a sadness. Gruff around his orphan charges, but cares for them well and does his best. Reserved with affection.

**History:** Raised by a single mother who struggled with addiction. He ended up signing on with [[The Sharpshooters]], where he met [[Kafr Da]], [[Shibu Olyah]] and [[Bey Thalla]]. Sailed with them for many years. After one voyage he found that his mother had met someone new, and was recovering, however the next time Lorch was in [[Ond Sâliya]] she had died. 

One day, coming back from a voyage that brought him to [[Ta Hio]] and [[Sheiteh-Yah]], he went to shore, ready to spend his wages drinking and fighting, and saw [[Bidri]], clutching a heavy rock, falling into the sea from a dock, clutching a heavy rock. He dove in and pulled her up. She didn't resist, but seemed rather to be in that strange trance-like state elves use instead of sleeping. Instead of spending his money on booze, he instead took up a room at [[The Sad Wolves]] and stayed with her until she returned to him. He eventually had to return to sea, and while they were never close friends, they maintained a relationship for many years afterwards. 

**Motivation:** He always wanted a family. During his time at sea, he became prone to violence and was often drunk. Some part of him realized that he would be a danger to any woman he let close to him because of this. 'My mother wasn't able to teach me much (though she did her best), and she managed to put some goodness deep inside me to realize that.' This is what led him to try and help desperate people in his neighborhood.

**Ideals:** Everyone deserves a chance to turn their life around, everyone deserves to be loved and supported.
**Flaws:** Compassion makes him vulnerable to deception.
**Bonds:** The orphans of [[Merleek]]

**Occupation:** Owner of the [[Salty Badger]]

**Family:** Mother Rinasha, dead, sister Uru, died as an infant. Possibly from his mother's neglect.
