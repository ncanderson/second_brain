Raw Radar. What is raw radar data? 
Rezboost is a proprietary feature for Furuno, so we may not be able to get the 'rawest' data.

We're unclear what DHS is looking for.
We don't need to compress, F5 will handle compression

## Todo:
Publish scanlines over LCM?
Can we go 'more upstream' from Furuno? ie raw energies
