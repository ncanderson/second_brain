# Hipheoth and Mithrolan
[[Y'Ghatan]] gate-breaker girt with silver

Wrought from nothing a mighty nation.

City after city succumbed to his army,

He enriched his people with that pillage

And gave lives freely to achieve his goal:

An empire stretching across the world.

The blood of thousands built his reign.

But his old age approaching swiftly

Put rancid fear in the ruler’s heart.

[[Mentu-em-Asim]] the [[King of Death]]

Has feasted long   on lamentations.

Slaking his thirst on the slaughtered throngs

King of the soul-hoard surveyed his demesne:

The keening wailing    of fresh-made widows,

Crying soldiers and anguished kin.

No few offers had come to his ears,

But the fresh taste of [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] begging

Caught the attentions of the elder god.

Countless dead had crossed the threshold

Of [[Mentu-em-Asim|Mentu-em-Asim’s]]   mortuary halls,

Of late the greatest tribute levied

Came from [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] wars of conquest.

His tearful prayers and grasping fingers

Had gained the attention of a powerful god.

Oath offered by [[Mentu-em-Asim]]:

  

“The price is set: all your people.

Send each one to me and in exchange

I will shut my gates against your soul

And return a measure of the slaughter you make,

Investing your flesh with the favor of a god.”

  

Gate-breaker replied with sanguine glee:

  

“The price is acceptable the oath is made.” 

  

[[Y'Ghatan]] life-stealer   extinguished his own people.

  

He summoned an army from their still-warm flesh

A kingly gift from the king of Death

A bond of power between the mighty.

Life-stealer marched   and monarch hungered

As dead legions laid waste to earth.

In dead as life leading the host

Great lords all, lunging charioteers

Foremost among them [[Belatsunat]].

Always whispering [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] advisor,

Her King’s proxy on the killing fields

[[Simit-sil-hak]] that rich state,

Lush with grass the ample grazing

Produced horses; the highest praises

Fell on Belat fiercest rider.

Her echelon of vehicles rode in the van

A thousand chariots warriors cheering

Oath-bound in death   spears and bows

Were carried by all arrayed for battle

The disciplined formation Belat’s finest.

And on the wings   ranging wide

The children of noble  charioteers rode.

Rode the horses trained to halter,

But too young still to join the slaughter

Wreaked in earnest by the vanguard.

Night riders ranging wide

Proficient at scouting  pillaging and screening

Five thousand there were no fewer than that

The greatest bulk of Belatsunat’s

Army arrayed was girt with armour

Of strongest bronze a forest of spears.

Ten thousand strong   the Dust Snakes,

Their broad shields bore proud devices

Each polished spearshaft in that thicket

Was dense enough to sink in water

Each tooled belt of broadest leather

Bore knives and cudgels killing tools

[[Harbiskiku]] of [[Ishkibal]]

Had also heard the summons and answered

Often standing at [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] side

Speaking calm where Belatsunat

Never covered her cruel blades

Harbishiku had exclusive rights

To mine the earth rightly receiving

Oceans of coin  for traded copper

No warrior himself, the haughty merchant

garbed his host in glorious cloths.

No soldiers more loyal would soon be found

[[Allatu the Archer]] of [[Ana-sin-Amid]]

Had also heard the summons and answered

His blood as hot as Belatsunat’s.

A vassal king he’d carved a realm

Fast against [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] borders

When Gate-breaker began his wars

Allatu challenged him to single combat

The sky darkened under Allatu’s shafts

But when the flight had finally ended

Gate-breaker stood   smiling slightly

Around him quivering  Allatu’s shafts

Beaming, the huntsman bent the knee

Long he had dreamed of a suitable lord.

Hunters he added to growing host

Proud skirmishers to screen the advance

Holy [[Ganeka]] lord of [[Darice]]

Had also heard the summons and answered.

With grave heart he heard the words

Whispered by [[Y'Ghatan]] when he needed solace,

Performed the rituals  of righteous faith,

Made the judgements, meted punishments

Gave the people the voice of god.

Bold templars  bearing sigils

Maintained obeisance in orderly patrols

Acolytes, scribes, full brothers and sisters,

Near three thousand   joined the force,

Their zeal a weapon, they never wavered.

[[Kishor]] of [[Damkina]] the crazed berzerker

Had also heard the summons and answered.

A monstrous name he was madness incarnate,

He feared no blade to rend his flesh

And stopped for nothing, he was an artist

At rending men their red his paint.

Kept bound and muzzled and starved for meat

That slavering avatar would be unleashed

When [[Y'Ghatan]] required maximum violence.

  

Maestar [[Sabium]] of [[Munawirton]]

Had also heard the summons and answered.

Frail and weak but a master of wizardry

Sabium would cloister herself with her spells

And emerge at last with lethal magic

Or blades that crackled with cruel enchantments.

In battles she would fling rolling fire

And savor the bouquet of sizzling flesh. 

  

[[Ea-Nasir]] of grand [[Gemerti]] 

Had also heard the summons and answered.

Second only to Simit-sil-Hak

In richness of soils and earth’s ripeness

Ea-Nasir oversaw the growth

Of the Dust-snake’s nourishing diet

Until their king ended their hunger.

Even so Ea-Nasir

Brought ten thousand towering spears

To augment levies from other lands

His fertile patrimony fecund even in death.

  

[[Pahas-Dell]] of [[Ulam-Burya]]

Had also heard the summons and answered.

  

[[Uktannu]] of [[Aloros]]

Had also heard the summons and answered.

  

Mustered and ready, [[Y'Ghatan]] begins his war

  

[[Hipheoth]]: soldier of the Hold of Life

Who gladly idled in dappled glades

With lyre and flute forever signing

A young woman in yellow raiment

With silver belt and black ringlets

All who looked upon her loved her,

A quiet inspiration for artists everywhere.

Wandering widely and exalting in worship,

Fatefully singing her favorite song

A lusty hymn, lauding bravery,

A tale of ancient clashing arms,

[[Hipheoth]] started hearing a ripping,

Ascendent screams from all around here.

Falling, stumbling, scraping her knees,

The Hold had shifted a thin hair’s-breadth

But Soldier was there to tell what she’d seen.

  

In lofty halls the Hold of Life

Solder told her fearful tale

[[Mentu-em-Asim]] Master of Death

Had made alliance with a mortal tool

And would upset the ancient balance

Of Life and Death if left unchecked, 

[[Vorphos]] was queen in vaulted hall,

[[Hunazios]] with her they heard [[Hipheoth]].

Her scorn unmasked [[Vorphos]] mocked:

  

“You’ve wasted your gifts now you goad me,

Worthless dreams of human worship.

The King of Death is cruel but weak,

No crafty ploy  perturbs me here.”

  

[[Hipheoth]] left then alone and humiliated

When shuffling feet stopped her short

[[Kelrias the Ancient]], Life’s own Priest

And Kin to [[Hipheoth]] through her mother.

Kelrias spoke 

 “Now with courage

We must act or be un-made.

Your mother bade me stand beside you,

I have heard your words and heeded 

We must enlist mighty allies

If we hope to hold the line.

[[Y'Ghatan]] gate-breaker and [[Mentu-em-Asim]]

Have together wrought tremendous ruin:

A people were killed and the holds collided - 

No house can stand without strong foundation”

  

With hopeful smile [[Hipheoth]] assented

For she was shamed  from her recent scolding.

[[Hipheoth]] and [[Kelrias the Ancient|Kelrias]] journey to each of the Holds, save the Hold of Death, and are turned away again and again, she too young and he too old to have much respect.

Their final chance they fearfully approached

The only god   they hadn’t entreated.

A looming fortress lay before them

Hearth of mighty [[Mithrolan]] the Champion.

With weary heart [[Hipheoth]] asked

For [[Mithrolan|Mithrolan’s]] aid and her biting axe.

[[Mithrolan]] spoke: 

“I know your errand.

[[Nidathan]], Mason of the [[Hold of Life]]

Came to sneer, that simpering fool

With my friendship he has forgotten his place.

[[Mentu-em-Asim]] has ended an age

When battle’s drought has drained away

It will be us with empty wineskins

Mortals will find their gods have failed.

I will fight beside your army,

Lacking worshippers gods are worthless”

  

And [[Hipheoth]] was glad, [[Mithrolan]] brought hope.

Together, [[Hipheoth]], [[Mithrolan]] and [[Kelrias the Ancient|Kelrias]] journey to all the people of the earth, mustering armies and mighty creatures to their task. 

The final inspection at last was finished

Years of marshalling   that mighty host

And the gods could finally gather to rest

Around crackling fire   they took their comfort

[[Hipheoth]] and [[Mithrolan]], hand in mighty hand,

[[Mithrolan|Mithrolan’s]] head on [[Hipheoth|Hipheoth’s]] shoulder.

Kelrias muttering crafting enchantments.

From the night a figure approached

A fist thrust in night’s throat,

Gaunt and hunched its voice was hoarse:


“Fifteen thousand will fight for me

And all will hear the words of a Herald

No Hold stands undivided

Shame to you  for shunning [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]]”

  

Abashed they were but emboldened also

[[Magor the Shovel]], foul smelling

His renowned honor   beyond repute.

The Herald of Death had is own designs:

Crafty[[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] forsaw his coronation.

Victory now certain with new alliance

[[Mentu-em-Asim]] would meet his mede

Morning dawned a day of slaughter

The time for words was finally over

The battle is joined, between the armies of the gods and [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] undead legions. Lasting nearly 50 years, at last, [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] army’s are spent and he is put to flight. The gods are approaching the King’s throne, when they learn of another attack from an unexpected direction.

The Hold of Life was hard pressed

Kelrias retreated to hold the rear

Three remained the renew the offensive

  

Winning the final battle and putting [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] army to rout, [[Hipheoth]], [[Mithrolan]] and [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] reach the doors of [[Mentu-em-Asim|Mentu-em-Asim’s]] hall.

[[Magor the Shovel|Magor's]] blow   with mighty fist

Split the bronze door asunder.

[[Mentu-em-Asim]] King of Death

Still enthroned but alone at last

Drew his sword from sable scabbard.

No words were spoken. All knew the stakes.

Hefting hammer [[Hipheoth]] charged,

To her left [[Mithrolan]] loped

Unquenched wrath then revealed.

Far to her right, fierce [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]]

Shovel aloft like broad-head spear.

The King held his ground crouching

A red torrent raging in his veins.

Soldier laid a swift blow

But [[Mentu-em-Asim]] made his escape,

Parrying swiftly with ringing sword 

Then twisting his blade to bind the swing 

Of [[Mithrolan|Mithrolan’s]] axe as she advanced.

[[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] launched a fearsome lunge

His keen shovel singing through the air

At the back of [[Mentu-em-Asim]]

Who turned about with viper alacrity

And ducked to the side of [[Magor the Shovel|Magor's]] strike.

  

Three full days these titans clashed

That battle hall full to bursting,

The ringing echoes could not escape.

Weary, thirsty, her movements thick

Soldier turned the thousandth strike

And Death-king wobbled he was weary also.

In that moment [[Mithrolan]] struck

The opening spotted, a slim hope

Blood-wet axe came arcing down.

But [[Mentu-em-Asim]] took the blow on his armour

And stepped inside [[Mithrolan|Mithrolan’s]] strike.

She hardly felt four feet of iron

Slipping easily straight through her.

That terrible blow sent [[Mithrolan]] tumbling

Her blood gushing from gaping rent.

Then [[Magor the Shovel|Magor's]] shovel smote the head

Of [[Mentu-em-Asim]] King of Death

And rent the skull with a wet scrape.

The king was staggered and fell back stumbling

[[Hipheoth]] sprang forward to finish the task

Savagely wielding her dull hammer

She crushed the bones of fallen king,

Sparks flying from the marble floor.

In triumph [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] turned to the throne

To claim the prize won with carnage

And seat himself to secure his glory.

To [[Magor the Shovel|Magor's]] horror the high-seat was taken,

Another reclined leg on arm-rest.

Roaring he charged raising his weapon

[[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] would have the prize that was his.

Nimbly rising the new king parried

Each ringing blow from rage-filled [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]].

He couldn’t land a single cut.

[[Hipheoth]] clutching her still companion

Gazed into eyes whose light had gone

The sleep of gods with grievous wounds

[[Mithrolan|Mithrolan’s]] blood marking her deeply.

Snarling [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] slunk from battle

Far too spent to continue the fight.

He turned to the Soldier swearing oaths:

  

“You have used me and enthroned your ally

A puppet of [[Vorphos]], this war a ploy

To remove the king [[Mentu-em-Asim]]

And claim the Hold for your own kind.”

  

Silent [[Hipheoth]] had no retort,

Wracked with grief her consort gone.

  

Then from the dais a delighted voice

  

“[[Liradel Indris]]” 

  

she said, laughing,

  

“Is my name I know you three.

Brave conquerors you’ve crushed [[Y'Ghatan]]

This throne now mine, I thank you for it.”

  

From behind her emerged four figures, *(ed. these are the [[Faceless Ones]], agents of [[Graiodhrra]])*

Cloaked in garments trimmed with silver

No features were there on their faces

Smooth and black as night-still waters.

[[Mentu-em-Asim|Mentu-em-Asim’s]] mortuary halls

Now belonged to a new monarch.

She spoke again to her silent companions:

  

“I’ve faithfully completed my side of the contract

And now hold all my heart desired.

Take these three and leave my realm

The Halls of Death are now my demesne.”

  

As the four undulated towards them

[[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] spat, to [[Hipheoth]] said:

  

“When I return and slay this whelp

I’ll be the King and you will quaver

The Hold of Life will leak its power

When I draw a blade across its belly.”

  

With that [[Magor the Shovel|Magor]] turned to mist

And fled the halls he’d hoped to win.

Holding close her still companion,

[[Hipheoth]] mustered her deepest magic,

Pouring the rest of her tattered compassion

Into a shield for sleeping [[Mithrolan]].

Waves of Chaos battered her consciousness,

No greater undertaking had she ever attempted.

After unknowable time [[Hipheoth]] knelt

And lifted her eyes to look at last

At what her craft had created for [[Mithrolan]].

Her body ruined now she could rest

In the marble tower [[Hipheoth]] had made.

Sanctuary and fortress while she slept

Recovering while her god-dreams rode the holds.

Again alone [[Hipheoth]] set out

To avenge the fallen and finish her task.

Shortly she arrived where her army was camped,

And [[Y'Ghatan]] remained his allies removed

Cordoned by her soldiers in deep caves.

Across the field where battle was fought

There walked three figures fearless striding

Towards [[Hipheoth|Hipheoth’s]] tent her high position

Regally surveying the crow-covered wreckage.

[[Thurey]] the Magi And [[Gwarles]] the Bearer 

[[Sod]] the Miner marching behind,

They called to the Soldier her captains around her:

  

“Brave [[Hipheoth]] we beg forgiveness

And answer your summons at this final hour

[[Y'Ghatan]] is trapped we three have trapped him

Encased his form in towering obsidian

Our arts united just as you asked”

  

“What have you wrought?” 

[[Hipheoth]] responded

  

“I’ve set you no task since you turned me away”

  

Sod the Miner stepped forward speaking:

  

“You came to each of us, one at a time

And named this place telling us you knew

The final stroke would fall on this plain.

You bade us wait and work a trap

To capture the gate-breaker under the ground.”

  

An icy horror gripped [[Hipheoth|Hipheoth’s]] bowels

She feared again she’d been out-flanked.

Into the tunnels she plunged, praying

She could arrive on time to temper the spell

And avenge her companion, ardent [[Mithrolan]].

In haste she ran, hearing in the dark

Echoing voices from every hold.

Kelrias was right the Holds had collided,

Every realm meeting at one littoral, 

These dripping grottos [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] spell-home.

She steeled herself and soldiered on

But was denied in deepest cavern.

The silent whisperer had worked its will

Her eyes could see power pulsing sickly

From a perfect cylinder of polished stone,

Locking away [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] [[phylactery]]

His mortal contract with [[Mentu-em-Asim]].

The Soldier roared spending her fury

Flashing her hammer, her hardest blow

Her hands shattered against the haft.

She reared again for another blow,

This second tore her hammer from her

But obsidian tower was still unmarked.,

With unquenched rage [[Hipheoth]] retreated

Her ruined hands hanging limply,

She scorned her weapon it had sickened her.

  

“What slithering thing has worked unseen

And set itself against my labors

Turning alliances into ashes

And snatching my vengeance when victory was won.

The three who wrought the spell that thwarts me

Are no allies to each other

And only once did I entreat them

I set them no task yet here they toiled

Blameless maybe they bore me no malice

But still my heart fills with hate.”

  

Ruined hands held before her

[[Hipheoth]] sought a certain banner

A band of [[dwarves]] loving the deeps,

That folk most ardent followers of [[Mithrolan]]

She bade them found a mighty fortress

To watch that prison: a weighty task 

For [[Y'Ghatan|Y'Ghatan’s]] own magery was undiminished

And [[Hipheoth]] feared he’d be free again.

Walking slowly with empty heart

Every footstep falling loudly

On broken blades and bleached bones.

She finally returned to Life’s reaches,

But no trumpets sounded her arrival.

The trees were gone under which she’d tarried

And played her harp the gladden hearts

Her own halls burned in some grim battle

The Hold of LIfe had been hard pressed.

Listless, Soldier sought the home

Of Kelrias the Priest her loyal kin.

Before the hall of brave Kelrias

[[Hipheoth]] saw [[Nidathan]], [[Hunazios]] too

And [[Vorphos]] was there a queen victorious.

But seeing [[Hipheoth]] her smile slipped

And approaching quietly the Queen said:

  

“Hear our sorrows, brave [[Hipheoth]]

Our pride has cost the highest price.

We are not un-made, yet not un-scathed

One more sorrow you must endure.

Within lies Kelrias your noble kin,

His wounds are bound, he is robed in white.

Not even my arts were enough to mend him.

He blessed you, his kin with his final breath.”

  

[[Vorphos]] had delivered the final disaster

And a black abyss opened beneath [[Hipheoth]],

And into that tumbled a shimmering silver

All that remained of [[Hipheoth|Hipheoth’s]] ardour.

As [[Vorphos]] called out her voice humble,

The Soldier of Life ignored her pleas:

  

“I’ve touched the Holds twisting together

Thinnest membrane restraining monsters.

The sands are falling for the final battle.”

  

The color fled from the face of [[Vorphos]]:

  
“We must rebuild and fortify anew,

Life is bulwark, beacon of salvation

And this battle smote a savage blow”

  

The Soldier of Life ignored her pleas,

Spinning on her heel [[Hipheoth]] turned

The smoke of her ruin swirling around her.
