## Nature of the Divine  
In a monotheistic religion, practitioners believe that there is only one God. In this case, they call that God by the name of God and they depict God variously as a man with a spear through his chest, a scorpion, or a trio of young women, or sometimes all of these together; in all cases these depictions are metaphorical. God is said to have given birth to the world.

## Meaning of Life  
According to this tradition, the great problem which besets the world and the mortals in it is living an inauthentic life. The only solution to this problem is following the ways of the world, which all of their religious practices and beliefs are directed towards.

## Clergy and Places of Worship  
Each community has and maintains its own sepulchre, where practitioners may stop by for comfort, guidance, private worship, or prayer. The sepulchre is laid out in a radially symmetrical pattern and its primary focal point is a tree of a rare species.

This religion does not have fixed clergy, but shamans wander from place to place, where they defend community members in civil courts,act as mediators for conflicts in the community,and negotiate with spirits. These shamans rely on their own wisdom, charisma, or power for their authority. They cannot marry and they take vows of celibacy. Sepulchres are maintained by volunteers from the community.

## Practices and Beliefs  
Practitioners visit burial places once a month,pray privately in their homes,and attend night worship each week in the sepulchre.

Tradition is passed down through a single carved codex kept in the Great Sepulchre.

Famously, members of this religion are strict vegetarians unless they are served meat when they are guests. There is also some controversy regarding this religion's custom of self-flagellation.

## History
This religion is notably revivalist. Centuries ago Teraphi built a great sepulchre, establishing this religion as a real power, but the sepulchre was destroyed and the tradition languished in almost complete obscurity for centuries until about two generations ago, when Teraphi's wisdom was rediscovered.

This religion now appears to be in decline.
