# Aehelis Shava Xilonodel
Elf-mother raped when foraging alone. Attacked by travelling soldier. She was shunned by [[wood elf]] clan who didn't believe her, left by her parther, exiled to the edge of the forest.

Aehelis grew up mostly alone, but travelled with mother to nearby cities for trade. Was often left alone to explore alone while mother did business.

Mother used to tell Aehelis of rape & details she could remember. A red haired large man w/ insignia depicting a blue dog with golden wings standing upon white flowers. ([[Pef Nokorsk]])

When Aehelis was 12 she travelled with her mother to a distant city and began to live in the outskirts. Mother's mental heath, which was unstable to begin with, deteriorated more and she drowned herself. 

Aehelis moved into the city [[Merrowmeadow]]. She was soon taken under the wing of a half elf named [[Peren]]. He taught her much and by age 16 she was his lover. Even though she flourished in the city life, she used to go to the woods to camp for a few weeks every year as a way to stay connected with her mother who never really loved Aehelis but whom Aehelis was devoed to anyways. Aehelis know her mother's unhappiness and death was her rapist father's fault.

Peren treated shelis with a mixture of control, neediness and lust, and had hit her enough times to make her resent him. He depended on her dependency. Aehelis used men as tools to get her needs met and her unique beauty caught their attentions. She honored a complicated affection for [[Peren]], who had saved her, but also used her and introduced her to the darkest side of life.

At 21 Aehelis was caught making love to [[Peren|Peren's]] sister [[Marta]]. Aehelis had to fell to [[Gadliegh]] and conned and thieved without restraint. She fled again to [[Cheva]] to begin a revenge quest to fine and kill her father.
