## Sending Bicom commands over HTTPS
Camera commands can be sent directly to the device using a web browser. This can be used to quickly test out different commands to the camera.

https://172.31.0.8/rcp.xml?command=0x09A5&type=P_OCTET&direction=WRITE&num=2&payload=0x800006011085000007

https://172.31.0.8/rcp.xml?command=0x029e&type=T_DWORKD&direction=READ&num=1

https://172.31.0.8/rcp.xml?
**command=0x09A5** - RCP Bicom command
**type=P_OCTET** - data type
**direction=WRITE** - not sure if/when we might use READ
**num=2** - 2 for thermal camera.
**payload=0x800006011085000007** - Bicom command

## Constructing Bicom data payloads

| Bits   | Description     |
|--------|-----------------|
| 81     | Command Flag    |
| 0004   | Cam Server      |
| 0507   | Bicom Command   |
| 02     | Bicom Operation |
| 0000   | Data Payload    |

## Heater Work
#### Bosch said that we shouldn't send heater command!!!
Heater 0x023.0 
SetGet
0 = Off
1 = Auto
2 = On
*2=On only available for Gen5 HD*
#### URL testing

Zooms fully in and out but is not selectable (i.e. there no selection for the amount of zoom to apply), and shows OSDÂ 

https://172.31.0.8/rcp.xml?command=0x09a5&type=P_OCTET&direction=WRITE&num=1&payload=0x810004050702000[0-c]

Selectable Zooming, but does not show OSD. Does not have the full range of zoom control that can be acheved via the web gui

It looks like the web gui is achieving its behavior by sending 'in full', followed quickly by 'stop'

## Video Stream URL Args
Arguments to add when connecting to the streams:
![[Pasted image 20221215113727.png]]
This isn't everything: 

| Arg | Format | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| h26x=0 | MJPEG | Works for all settings |
| h26x=3 | MPEG-4 SH++ | Does not appear to work on this camera |
| h26x=4 | H.264 | Requires camera set to H.264 via config menu |
| h26x=5 | HEVC / H.265 | Requires camera set to H.265 via config menu |

## Reconnecting to a video stream
Sometimes the video stream craps out.

- go to dashboard
- view active connections - kb value indicated there was visual output but no thermal output on video 2
- video 2 showed 0 resolution (0x0) for video streams
- jpg stream showed something else

something going on with the video encoder output for the video camera streams

- go to config > camera > encoder regions
- there was thermal data showing up, all indicates that the thermal camera was working
- encoder streams, tab 2, click 'set'
- video 2 tab

## Backup Config
You can download a file with all current config

## Azimuth
