# jungle plot points

A hermit, wearing the guise of the [[Weeping Mother]] but actually the [[Tooth Hag]], lives under [[Horseshoe Falls]]. There she has a close relationship with the [[Star-touched]] being who inhabit the jungle. Some of them work with her willingly, some unwillingly, and some are her unfortunate subjects of study.

Canoe bearing three [[Supplicants of the Weeping Mother|figures in long black robes/dresses, hoods up, heads in hands]]. Supplicants of the weeping mother. people who live along the river sometimes bring children to the [[Tooth Hag]] believing her to protect the [[Horseshoe River]].

River lined with grass figurines, tied to trees. Despite the supposed protection of the Tooth Hag, people are often going missing from villages clustered along the river. It's a dangerous life.
