# Shyldrarith
An ancient green [[Dragons|dragon]]. Could shape-shift into a humanoid form, resembling a tall, lithe elf. Was captured and bound to the ruins of [[Sheiteh-Yah]] by [[Mentu-em-Asim]]. [[The Dianes]] fought Shyldrarith while attempting to defeat [[Y'Ghatan]] and believed they slew him, but he was able to nurse himself back to health. He survived [[Cataclysm|the cataclysm]] while recovering underground and emerged to a different world. 

Shyldrarith searched long for a new home, before finding comforting and familiar terrrain in western [[Eukarth]], in the [[Jungle of Nyajir]] near [[Mount Lanmier]]. Shyldrarith found a mate and had young offspring there with [[Ylborror]], a younger green dragon. After the egg hatched, the pair had a falling out and [[Ylborror]] fled the area of [[Mount Lanmier]] where she staked out a new territory in and around the [[Horseshoe River]] The two often came to blows.

## Demi-dragon Offspring
In ancient times, was a companion of [[Mithrolan]], and the pair would often roam together. They had a fractious relationship, and sojourns they took together often ended in blows. Together, [[Mithrolan]] and [[Shyldrarith]] gave birth to the first demi-dragon kin. Their first-born was the first [[half-dragon]], who inherited much of Shyldrarith's cunning, greed and lust for power. Their second-born was the first [[dragonborn]], who took more after [[Mithrolan]], though still exhibited much of Shyldrarith's draconic influence. The struggles that resulted from the friction between this offspring proved to be the final sundering of Shyldrarith and [[Mithrolan]].
