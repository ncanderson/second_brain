# The Dark Hand
The Dark Hand is of course hated by the Royal Family and much of the wealthy contingent of the city's population. Below the privileged classes they are sometimes hated and sometimes not. Non-[[changeling|changelings]] are VERY hesitant to support or tangle with them in any way because persecution is so rapid and extreme for anyone exposed as a changeling or changeling supporter. The Dark Hand changelings are also very hesitant to recruit or otherwise depend on any non-changeling unless the benefit is too great to ignore.
