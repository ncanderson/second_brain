Days:  
1: Campaign begins in nation of [[Questan]], the city of [[Gadliegh]]. [[Jurgis Abraitis]], the patriach of the [[Abraitis Family]] and current duke controlling much of southern [[Questan]]. Party journeys to [[Cheva]], a town on the border of the [[Black Rabbit Steppe]], west of the [[Kielk River]]. The group convened at [[The Fatted Cow]], a rough border tavern (See also [[Colonialism of the Black Rabbit Steppe]]). Party met [[Cafatia Thefrinal]], a wizard who sent them on a journey to check in on a border tower. After a bar-room brawl, [[Tupac]] manages to come away with a short sword bearing the insignia of [[Vygintas Abraitis]].

2: At the border fort, it is discovered that orcs are being bred to create a new race. [[Cafatia Thefrinal]] traps the group in the tower. They manage to find a boat that will carry them down an underwater river. A waterfall destroys the boat but the party makes their way clear of the wreckage. Following a battle with [[zombies]], the party continues into a massive [[dwarven|dwarves]] city - [[Old Gerngarum]]. They meet [[The Heresiarch]] in an underground settlement, where a small community of religious refugees are living a subsistence lifestyle harvesting massive mushrooms. The party rests among the mushrooms. They learn that [[The Heresiarch]] fears a conflict is brewing, something that is more pressing than the dynastic squabble between the children of the [[Abraitis Family]]. [[Cafatia Thefrinal]] in particular is bad news.

3: Led by secret paths, out of [[Old Gerngarum]]. After a brief battle with a Quasit (A minor [[Demon]]), [[The Dianes]] find themselves on the road running north back towards [[Gadliegh]]. Seeing armies on the march, they do their best to disguise themselves as cleric. They are swept up on the armies advance by troops marching forth from [[Gadliegh]]. A magical exchange wrought devastation on both armies, and as the heroes begin to recover from the events they just witnessed, a fresh horror emerges. The ground begins to shake. Many of those on the ground stand up and begin streaming back to [[Gadliegh]] and [[Curlisbrooke]], and many who were slain begin to stand, new Zombies at [[Cafatia Thefrinal|Cafatia's]] beck and call. A [[half-orc]] steppe army begins fanning out into the country-side, having been moved their by [[Cafatia Thefrinal]]. The ground begins to crack, and an [[The Spire|obsidian spire]] begins rising. The largest rises from where Cafatia was, with more thrusting up around. They are all adorned with dwarven runes. A spire of light pour forth and the spire shatters. [[Dannick the Daring|Dannick's]] mind is broken in a way that will haunt him for the rest of his days.

4: Fleeing the horror of the battle they witness, [[The Dianes]] head through the night to try and find [[Dannick the Daring|Dannick's]] farm. On arriving, his family is nowhere to be found, the sheep are running free. [[Tupac]] recovered from the mental shock of the spire emerging. Several zombies, having been brought back from the unleashing of [[The Spire|the spire's]] magic, attack. Head towards [[Merrowmeadow]] to figure out what to do. They run through the night, finding no rest. A boulder provides some measure of respite but not a full rest. It starts to become clear that the energies unleashed by the spire rising have triggered a necromatic wave, and a mass of zombies are now spilling out in all directions. Taking shifts and hoping zombies pass by or are few enough we can take them out. 

5: Head north one hour towards [[Merrowmeadow]], big flashes happening towards [[Kielk]] to the east. We head towards south fork to ford. Large monster smashing zombies. Slumped man in yellow robes, we move towards man. Dannick casts ... Two zombies out of nowhere. Tupac lands solid blows on big guy. Aehelis slices arm of little one. Dannic throws a sacred flame at little guy, then tupac flurry of blows little guy to bits. Ogre attackes, Aehelis hits with a bow. Dannick misses with sacred flame. [[Orcustus]] slipos away with magic. Saka hits with arrow. Tupac misses with fury of blows. High council of wizards sent [[Orcustus]] to mitigate crisis. Several centers of strange magic around [[Gadliegh]]. Trying to clear paths to (?). Still 2.5 to 3 days from [[Merrowmeadow]]. Orcusts thinks we can be helpful. Gives a token, a 'business card'. Find a Wand of Secret Passages in the Ogre's horde. Talk to Orcustus and head towards riverhole (?). Long rest at an inn. Go into the tunnel, begin descent to [[Old Gerngarum]]. 

6: Meet black eyed dwarves in [[Old Gerngarum]]. They ask Tupac why he doesn't know about "the gifts of their lord". He responds "I'm not familiar with that but I'm open to anything". One went to send a message to the captain, something about closing a book. They don't seem to respond to [[Krivnux]]. One of them's head bursts into flames. Tupac confliced over lethal actions against another dwarf. Tupac reads the log, forges an entry. Long rest.

7: day 1 in [[Old Gerngarum]]. Exploration, traversal of passages. Find a secret passage that leads into a dump. Meet [[Papa Mamut]]. Encounter a baby blue dragon, and kill it.

8: Meet [[Thud]], who identifies himself as a [[Rats of Tuvari]]. Thud says the black-eyed dwarves have been down in [[Old Gerngarum]] for like 10 years. Not all of them have black eyes. Knows about [[The Heresiarch]], but nothing about the spire. A flight of black pegasi attack the group. With a nat 20, [[Saka]] leaps on the back of the pegasus and flies off.   

9: roof battle, sowing confusion  
Group sees [[Cafatia Thefrinal]] with a group of dwarves and half orcs, who are arguing with each other. One of the dwarves is larger than the others (I think it's actually [[Krivnux]]). She says she's ready to go meet her master who's free to walk the earth again. A battle ensues, as the party attempts to stop the half orcs. 
> At this point the details from the first-hand document seem to diverge with the official record of days. The next series of events described appears to take fewer than the two full days indicated in the official record. Those records are notated as: 
   10: getting in  
   11: dragon  
> It's possible that the events described on day 9 end with a long rest, but this is unclear from the available texts. It will be assumed that the action resumes on day 10. ([[Belphegor|Belphegor's]] note)

10: Group finds the base of the obsidian spire. There is a dragon chained to a machine attached to the spire. Lots of half orcs around. Via telepathy, feeling of deep, crushing despair. Cafatia approaches the spire with a black box. There are dead, prostrate figures around the base of the spire. Drowned in blood. Thousands of them. Three of Cafatia's thugs try to get the party. Aehelis moves to the machine, and pulls the spikes out of the blue dragon. Dragon is freed. There is something of a civil war occurring (why?), as the black eyed dwarves, half orcs and black robed guys fight each other. There are so many of them. [[Ganeka]] and [[Kishor]] are names said by the fleeing guardians of (?). The dragon swears allegiance to the group for its freedom, and offers a ride to the party. As they begin to leave, [[Rats of Tuvari]] reemerge, and toss a bundle to Aehelis, saying that "Tuvari has chosen you". [[The Heresiarch]] opposed getting carried by the dragon, and struggled but was lifted. Dannick carried the magnificent hammer he was carrying. The bundle handed to Aehelis was a long, mushroom-wood box with a small bow, intricately made, with an image of a rat on it. 

> At this time, it's unclear what The Heresiarch's role in the battle was, though he appeared to have been there with his followers and participated to some degree.

Dragon carries the group out of the caves, and they emerge near the [[Rust Mountains]] east of [[Cheva]]. It's possible they rest here with [[Jaragon]] for a night. The main spire is visible, as well as several smaller ones that have emerged from around it. Head towards [[Cennan]], landing on the central white spire, surrounded by smaller spires. The dragon's name is [[Jaragon]]. She wants to talk to [[Grifflin]], but [[Grifflin]] has been dead for a long time and apparently [[Jaragon]] didn't know (spoiler alert, Grifflin is in hiding). The new master of the wizards is (Nox?).

12: [[Council of Cennan]]
Wizard council. Group given leave to speak by the token of [[Orcustus]]. The council is mired is hopeless beauracracy. Each wizard accumulates chips that they can use to speak. It becomes clear that no one present is interest in helping with the current events, beyond the sending of [[Orcustus]]. There is however one wizard, with a mountain of chips, who does wish to speak. He uses all of them at once. He speaks of 

That night the party is attacked by an assassin.
