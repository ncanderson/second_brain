# Oskora catalog of days
Days:  
1: Campaign begins in nation of [[Questan]], the city of [[Gadliegh]]. [[Jurgis Abraitis]], the patriach of the [[Abraitis Family]] and current duke controlling much of southern [[Questan]]. Party journeys to [[Cheva]], a town on the border of the [[Black Rabbit Steppe]], west of the [[Kielk River]]. The group convened at [[The Fatted Cow]], a rough border tavern (See also [[Colonialism of the Black Rabbit Steppe]]). Party met [[Cafatia Thefrinal]], a wizard who sent them on a journey to check in on a border tower. After a bar-room brawl, [[Tupac]] manages to come away with a short sword bearing the insignia of [[Vygintas Abraitis]].

2: At the border fort, it is discovered that orcs are being bred to create a new race. [[Cafatia Thefrinal]] traps the group in the tower. They manage to find a boat that will carry them down an underwater river. A waterfall destroys the boat but the party makes their way clear of the wreckage. Following a battle with [[zombies]], the party continues into a massive [[dwarven|dwarves]] city - [[Old Gerngarum]]. They meet [[The Heresiarch]] in an underground settlement, where a small community of religious refugees are living a subsistence lifestyle harvesting massive mushrooms. The party rests among the mushrooms. They learn that [[The Heresiarch]] fears a conflict is brewing, something that is more pressing than the dynastic squabble between the children of the [[Abraitis Family]]. [[Cafatia Thefrinal]] in particular is bad news.

3: Led by secret paths, out of [[Old Gerngarum]]. After a brief battle with a Quasit (A minor [[Demon]]), [[The Dianes]] find themselves on the road running north back towards [[Gadliegh]]. Seeing armies on the march, they do their best to disguise themselves as cleric. They are swept up on the armies advance by troops marching forth from [[Gadliegh]]. A magical exchange wrought devastation on both armies, and as the heroes begin to recover from the events they just witnessed, a fresh horror emerges. The ground begins to shake. Many of those on the ground stand up and begin streaming back to [[Gadliegh]] and [[Curlisbrooke]], and many who were slain begin to stand, new Zombies at [[Cafatia Thefrinal|Cafatia's]] beck and call. A [[half-orc]] steppe army begins fanning out into the country-side, having been moved their by [[Cafatia Thefrinal]]. The ground begins to crack, and an [[The Spire|obsidian spire]] begins rising. The largest rises from where Cafatia was, with more thrusting up around. They are all adorned with dwarven runes. A spire of light pour forth and the spire shatters. [[Dannick the Daring|Dannick's]] mind is broken in a way that will haunt him for the rest of his days.

4: Fleeing the horror of the battle they witness, [[The Dianes]] head through the night to try and find [[Dannick the Daring|Dannick's]] farm. On arriving, his family is nowhere to be found, the sheep are running free. [[Tupac]] recovered from the mental shock of the spire emerging. Several zombies, having been brought back from the unleashing of [[The Spire|the spire's]] magic, attack. Head towards [[Merrowmeadow]] to figure out what to do. They run through the night, finding no rest. A boulder provides some measure of respite but not a full rest. It starts to become clear that the energies unleashed by the spire rising have triggered a necromatic wave, and a mass of zombies are now spilling out in all directions.
