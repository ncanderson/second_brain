# Zook Dargell Zumbleduck
Gnome, lost looking. Has an appearance of one out of place.
Trying to answer 'The Question'

- There is a library
- Colleague died (murdered) because they got too close to something
- Looking for a book about the shattering written by former

Found a spider-like magical component that was taken from the dehumidifier at [[The Blue Faces]] library.

### Projects
- Defense of the [[Salty Badger]], especially something that [[Skeent]] and [[Mags]] can use
	- Made some progress with a 15

### Associations
- [[Tifafyx Thundercord]], who was murdered

### Patron 
Zook's patron is a fey creature named [[Ail'uned]]

So he’s aesthetically and personality wise a very real combination of these two fellas…  
Dobby and zei from Avatar last Airbender  
We’ve got the excitable, learning-obsessed, driven and scholarly Professor Zei from Avatar the Last Airbender  
And then kind, genuine, crafty, caring Doby  
Maaaaaaybe there’s like a smidge bit of this fella?(legolas) Or maybe that’s just my childhood crush coming thru ![:joy:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f602.png) this one v debatable. Maybe this is his type???  
He’s a learner for sure, and very much of the earth as a rock gnome…however his life’s learning and passion is around the *stars*  
A grounded tinkering rock gnome who is looking to the heavens for information  
He is driven by a sole question, and he is trying to find any means of discovering the answer….and the question is *very much* related to those meteors that came down to earth during the great shattering  
He has a letter from a dead colleague who was also his best friend, and they were pursuing this investigation together…tragically his friend was murdered, likely because he found out information he was not supposed to know  
Ever since his friend’s tragic death Zook has been a little aimless and laying very very low…it’s been several years now, and he’s been low key wandering and grieving and also still driven to find out the answer to his question  
Ahhhh perhaps he took the path of the warlock and made a deal with the David Bowie esque deity  as a way to have more power…this astronomer sage was looking for a way to be more powerful, to move beyond his tinkering and his studies and find out what was possible with *magic*  
He has no family - his parents died long ago and he was never close with his distant relatives - and he will likely never return to his home of origin
