# Darowon Dondro
[[Darawon Dondro]], 32 year old [[human]] male. Sorcerer. Father ([[Luurx|Kendak Danarga]]) died from a mining accident. Mother ([[Aunn|Althea Danarga]]) was murdered. From the desert city of [[Delenon]]. I owe my life to my [[dragonborn]] friend [[Unkus Hazar]] for taking care of me when I was orphaned. 

Secret: [[Luun]] (changeling birth name), 20 year old [[changeling]], I want to avenge my mother's death by overthrowing two great powers in my home city. 

The changeling [[Luun]] ([[Darawon Dondro]]) was born in the desert city of [[Delenon]] to parents [[Aunn]] (Althea Danarga) and [[Luurx]] (Kendak Danarga). The city of [[Delenon]] is plagued by [[The Dark Hand]], a thieves’ guild of doppelgangers and evil changelings that tirelessly work to corrupt and collapse the wholly oppressive royal family. In turn the royal family and a large portion of the city’s population distrust [[shapeshifters]] and aim to systematically eradicate them.

Darawon’s parents were “[[changeling|passers]]”, each choosing and adhering to one persona and living a simple earnest life. His parents both ran a successful jewelry shop in Delenon. One day while Kendak was visiting the mines for updates on recent findings he died when a mineshaft collapsed. When bodies were recovered his changeling identity was discovered. Before word of Kendak’s death reached Althea, the royal family was informed and sentinels were sent to slay her under the assumption that she too must be a changeling. This left 6 year old Darawon an orphan.

At the time of his mother’s murder, Darawon was with a family friend, a brass dragonborn named [[Unkus Hazar]]. Unkus was one of their closest friends and the only non-changeling friend that knew of their true identity. When Unkus heard of Kendak and Althea’s demise he swore an oath to support Darawon as best he could. Taking him in full time would have raised suspicion so Darawon split his time between the streets, Unkus’ house, and later the den of a brass dragon. Darawon’s presence in Delenon made Unkus uneasy. One day when Darawon was 8 years old, Unkus took him on a trek into the desert introducing him to a dear friend and mentor, [[Lyzeilioth]] the brass dragon. Darawon and the brass dragon became fast friends. Lyzeilioth never tired of the child’s stories, uncovering the many layers of Delenon from the eyes and ears of an 8 year old. Darawon often stayed at the lair for weeks, sometimes months, before heading back to Delenon to refresh supplies and experiences to share with Lyzeilioth. Unkus would always rest easy when Darawon was in the safe company of Lyzeilioth, far from the city.

In their time together Lyzeilioth revealed what she saw in Darawon, the sorcery in his blood. Lyzeilioth surmised this was passed down from Darawon’s parents, a secret they kept from him and perhaps never intended to reveal. Lyzeilioth mentored Darawon in awakening his magical powers and delighted in watching him practice magic in the lair. As a gift Lyzeilioth infused Darawon’s blood with her own, becoming his dragon-mother and augmenting his innate sorcerous bloodline.

Darawon maintains connections with [[Unkus Hazar]] and through Unkus, [[Lyzeilioth]]. He sends money and gifts to Unkus. Some of the money is for Unkus to keep, some is to store away for the attempt to overthrow power in [[Delenon]]. The gifts are to be passed from Unkus to Lyzeilioth. Darawon does maintain contacts with a few other close friends in the city but does not send them goods or money. 

Darawon seeks revenge on the royal family yet he doesn't trust the deeper motives of The Dark Hand and will not join them. At the age of 20 Darawon embarks on an epic journey to amass stories of adventure to bring back to his dragon-mother Lyzeilioth. He also seeks wealth and magical power to someday aid him in overthrowing the royal family of Delenon and The Dark Hand. Bringing balance to the people of Delenon, proving once and for all that changelings are not solely bound to evil paths. 


How did the draconic blood happen? There is some lore related to dragonborn that never came out last campaign. [[Mithrolan]] and [[Shyldrarith]] were the source of the first dragonborn. Those first children proved to be difficult to manage, and their various natures led to strife between their sires, ultimately ending the relationship between Mithrolan and Shyldrarith, who up to that point would often cavort together.

With the destruction of the hold of stone, there is some potential to explore that draconic blood and what it means now With was a god of stone). Or maybe not and one of your parents was seduced by a dragon.

The new race/multiclass brings with it a different background and slightly darker character motives. Urchin Changeling Draconic Sorcerer/ Lore Bard, sneaky, deceptive, and persuasive, treasure and artifact hunter. Still a steal from the rich share with the poor kinda character but less footloose and fancy free as the cat was and not averse to amassing a reasonable amount of personal wealth in the process. He lived a hard life on the streets and would like to bury many of those memories in the past. 

I'd like to keep the Changeling a secret from the party for now. My character, Darawon Dondro, will enter the story appearing like a normal human.
