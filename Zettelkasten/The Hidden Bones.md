# The Hidden Bones

**Name**: The Hidden Bones
**Type**: Criminal Organization
**Motivation**: Acquisition of wealth

An group heavily involved in organized crime in [[Ond Sâliya]]. Led by [[Cure Tue]], headquartered at [[The Rotten Horse]]. This organization is the de facto government for the [[Lawmark]] neighborhood, and nothing happens in that area of the city without the knowledge of [[Cure Tue]] and the organization. As an effort to combat crime in [[Ond Sâliya]], the government of the [[Obraria Influence|Obrarian area]] granted the Hidden Bones control of this neighborhood to use as a dumping ground for criminals and debtors. The organization in turns finds fertile recruitment because of this policy. In return, The Hidden Bones is free to perform dubious tasks on behalf of the Obrarian government while leaving them a sliver of legitimacy. 

There is an operative within the organization that is dissatisfied with [[Cure Tue|Cure Tue's]] leadership, and seeks to supplant her. [[Bidri]] has thus far been able to escape detection, and may have brought [[Luten]] on board with the plot.
