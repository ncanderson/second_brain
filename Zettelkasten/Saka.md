# Saka
[[Askuzai]] ranger/warrior. Human.

Saka is a scout and raider with her tribe, the Askuzai, a society of women warriors who specialize in mounted archery.  Askuzai girls begin their athletic and martial training very young, and have a deeply intuitive bond with their steeds.  They reproduce by taking male breeding partners from the towns on the outskirts of their grassland territory (which is called the Kuza).  None of the Askuzai warriors are allowed to breed until they have killed a man in battle, to assure that only the women with courageous spirits and a healthy bloodlust get to create the tribal lineage.  [[Askuzai]] who break this taboo and get pregnant before their first kill are banished from the Kuza.  The women raise their daughters in the tribe, and once a year they ship all the male infants down the Mato River on a shallow-keeled longship bound for ?????? (wherever our story begins).  The boys are traded to Kentashi merchants, in exchange for the finest saddles and bridles that money can buy (the Kentashi are legendary leatherworkers from the North).  As far as the Askuzai know, the boys are apprenticed in the leather trade and become fine craftsmen.  But no one has checked on this arrangement in a century or so, and is that really what becomes of them?  The Askuzai would need to seek vengeance if something more dishonorable was happening to the boy-children...  While they ban men from their camps, maternal instincts are incorrigible and they take pride on sending off their boy-children to a good life.

  

This year Saka had to take her turn escorting the cargo boy-children to the city where they are traded to the Kentashi merchants.  It's an unpopular job because you have to travel by boat and leave your horse behind, which no Askuzai woman wants to do.  Several Askuzai mothers travel with the cargo as wet-nurses, and Saka is their non-lactating warrior guard (at 28 years old, she has killed many men in battle, but has not yet chosen to bear a child).

My idea for her entry into the storyline is that the ship has been raided and she has been captured.  Perhaps she is being transported in a medieval paddy-wagon, destined for the slave market?  To be sold as an exotic woman gladiator?  And this wagon passes by the Rogue and the Cleric as they are leaving town?  Or maybe she's escaped her bonds in the night and snuck off after reclaiming her weapons, and tries to steal food from the other adventurers and they catch her?  I feel like I should leave the exact details of how this weaves together to you as the DM...  

I like the idea of her starting the adventure horse-less, but having a strong priority of acquiring a new horse as soon as possible.

  

Also, just for the record, Murphy doesn't hate men...  Saka kind of despises them, but that's her culture... just in case that wasn't clear ;-)
