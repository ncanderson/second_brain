### Idea seeds for NPC's
- Dodgy dwarf dreads delving deeply, drinks daintily, discovered delicate doilies.
- Sheltered virgin daughter of a noble has developed a highly romantic passion for all things elven, making things ticklish for any adventurer of elvish blood hired to serve in her escort.
- Handsome, articulate merchant who is troubled by rotten body odor that creates awkward social situations.
- Thin, snooty librarian with a taste for truly horrendous puns.
- A stout dwarven warrior, steady in battle, but apt to get into his cups, during which he will tell stories where the exploits of others become his own to the annoyance of any companions.
- An outcast gnoll with a broken voice seeks enrolment at the most famous bardic college in the realm to escape the violence of his people and find the song of his soul in the world.
- A mind-flayer in control of a famous poet, using the poet's fame to spread enchanted texts in an attempt to attract meals.
- Big, stupid, half-orc barbarian is an uncoordinated meat shield by day and an eloquent novelist by night.
- An old, attractive, retired healer, the real father of dozens of townspeople, including the current duke.
- No-one makes such good cinnamon buns than the kind lady who lives by the creek, but few could guess that her secret lies in the infernal pits of chaos.
- Gnomish priest with major delusions of grandeur, repeatedly uses the phrase 'I am a god' every time he casts a divine spell, but will only help those who help themselves.
- An elven actor, star of 'The Willow Road' play.
- A small, friendly, unwashed orphan from the streets who mutters to himself and claims to hear voices, and is actually a powerful natural telepath who can't stop reading minds.
- The highly capable prince does not allow any female elves or gnomes to live in his kingdom unless they first spend the night in his bedchambers.
- This former paladin now at temples does jest, though secretly yearns that his sins were confessed.
- A socially-inept genius whose grand plans and good intentions are ultimately undone by complacency and lethargy.
- A fun-loving hired gun with impeccable aim, a big, soft heart, and an unquenchable thirst for shooting things, is best known for his offensive jokes, non-stop laughter, and swearing.
- Big, friendly, lummox of a barbarian who loves his weekly bar fights - too bad he usually ends up turning into a grizzly bear after getting a bloody nose.
- Halfling hero leaves home, grows, lives, loves, dies screaming.
- A hard faced guard loves sewing in his time off, but is embarrassed by his beautiful works and so claims his non-existent wife is responsible.
- Depressed elementalist has forgotten how to summon all but the nicest of weather.
- The genteel captain of the merchant vessel who recently kidnapped his identical twin brother, to take his place to hide from authorities, is actually a trained assassin responsible for the death of someone close to the PCs.
- A peaceful artist whose preferred medium is the blood and organs of his victims.
- Elvish wizard dreams of one day being part of the upper classes, and partakes in adventure between producing pieces of artwork in an attempt to obtain the fame and coin to move up in society (but has gambling and drinking problems that prevent him from getting ahead in life).
