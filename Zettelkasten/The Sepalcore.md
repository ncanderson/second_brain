# The Sepalcore

**Name**: The Sepalcore
**Type**: Secret cabal within [[Bloomhaven]]
**Description**: Most members of [[Bloomhaven]] do not know that their community is a front for an entrenched cabal of druids who cultivate a wide variety of [[Star Spawn]] plants and fungi used in the production of dangerous potions and drugs, for sale to the highest bidders. For the youth and majority of adult community members, their insular community is a place of light, goodness, and peace. They are mostly ignorant of what goes on outside their walls, and entirely in the dark regarding the cabal and it's dealings.
