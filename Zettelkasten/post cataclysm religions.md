# Post Cataclysm Religions
Following [[The Descent]] of the [[Star Spawn]] and the subsequent cataclysmic sundering of the world, the [[Hold|Holds]] were broken. The [[The Ancient Ones]] who had made this [[Plane of Existence]] and the structure of the holds to seal it away from the chaotic forces that sought to topple all their creations had bound within it the means of its own protection. 5 [[Planar Defender|Planar Defenders]] were imbued with the power of the [[Hold|Holds]] themselves

Following the battle where the champions managed to prevent the total destruction of the world, the [[Hold|Holds]] were destroyed, having poured all their energy into the defense. What remained were the ascended beings, each of them having been the god of one of the [[Unaligned]] holds.
