##### **How do I freeze for my minor child?**

If you are a parent or guardian of a minor and would like to freeze their credit report, we can help. Here's what you'll need to provide.

1.  A written request to place a “protected consumer freeze” on the named individual’s file
2.  **AND** a copy of one piece of documentation that provides ‘sufficient proof of authority’ that you have authority to act on behalf of the minor or dependent such as:  
    -   an order issued by a court of law
    -   a lawfully executed and valid power of attorney
    -   a document issued by a Federal, State, or local government agency in the United States showing proof of parentage, including a birth certificate
    -   with respect to a protected consumer who has been placed in a foster care setting, a written communication from a county welfare department or its agent or designee, or a county probation department or its agent or designee, certifying that the protected consumer is in a foster care setting under its jurisdiction.
    
3.  **AND** information or a copy of documentation that provides ‘sufficient proof of identification’ that you are who you really are, and information or a copy of documentation that the minor/dependent is who they really are, such as:  
    -   a Social Security number or a copy of a Social Security card issued by the Social Security Administration
    -   a certified or official copy of a birth certificate issued by the entity authorized to issue the birth certificate
    -   a copy of a driver’s license, an identification card issued by the motor vehicle administration, or any other government issued identification

Please only send copies of documents, not original documents.

Send everything here:

**TransUnion**  
**P.O. Box 380**  
**Woodlyn, PA 19094**

Please note: Consumers are not able to place a protected consumer freeze via phone or online at this time due to the documentation requirements. We accept either standard or certified mail.
