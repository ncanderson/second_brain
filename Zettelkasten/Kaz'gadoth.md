# Kaz'gadoth
**Description:** A demon, currently inhabiting the body of an unknown native of [[Eukarth]]. When in the presence of that body, a heavy buzzing sound fills people's minds.

On examination, the body's skin seems to be moving independently of the body, resembling a layer of tight clothing sliding over the body inside.

Doesn't speak directly to the party, instead murmuring something in an unknown language. They will whisper in the minds of anyone close by.

**Personality:** Delirious, nonsensical. 

**History:** [[Kaz'gadoth]] 'took' the body they currently inhabit, and slunk off to the jungle. [[Klash]] the troll was ensnared. There may be other puppets that are released if [[Kaz'gadoth]] is excised from the body.

**Motivation:** Unknown. A minor entity who was commanded to maintain control of [[Klash]] the troll.

**Ideals:** A loyal servant, but primarily motivated by fear
**Flaws:** A true coward at heart
**Bonds:** Feels a small, perverted sense of duty towards their puppets

**Family:** Unknown

**Associations:** 
- [[Fraz Urb'luu]]
- [[Klash]]

**Voice:** labored, buzzing, with a psychic echo
