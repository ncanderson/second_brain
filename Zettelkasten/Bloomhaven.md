Also known as [[The Enclave]].

**Type**: Community of insular druids

**Description**: A planned community of predominantly half-elf druids - not unlike a cultish suburb - known to produce flowering plants for sale through a few limited contact points: 
- a small shop attached to the outside of the enclave walls  
- an exclusive to-order floral house, situated in a well-to-do neighborhood just inside the city proper, staffed by hired locals, managed by a few enclave (likely [[The Sepalcore|Sepalcore]]) members  
Sanctimonious adults cleave to a system of beliefs and practices that emphasize ceaseless positivity, muted celebration, agreeable obedience, and ornamental flower gardening to support those needs of the enclave that can not be met by their own efforts.
