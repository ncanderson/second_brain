# Noam
Halfling
Vain, sharp grey clothing. Uses layers and accessories to appear styling though his garb is plain. Dark curly hair.

Plays the spoons and sing. Also has a lyre.

Playing at [[Salty Badger]] for a few weeks to a month.

Has a thing against prep school boys

Noam's mom Nasiya is a traveling circus performer and possibly also sex worker, noam's tried very hard to not pay too much attention to that part. He grew up in his early years on the road in the performance industry but she sent him to boarding school because she wanted a better life for him, specifically more elitist artistry, like to be a performer in Oskora's Carnegie Hall equivalent (or whichever continent has bountiful halflings). At school he met Harrigan (Harry), Roscoe (Ross), and Dingman (Dingo), a trio of golden-ringleted cherub-faced halflings who grew up together in whatever the bougiest version of The Shire is around here. They'd been looking for a fourth bandmate to add allure and mystery without bringing down the hotness level of The Shire Boys, and Noam fit the bill. They started touring upon graduation, found success, but for the rest of the band it was really about the lifestyle and the groupies, they don't need the money or clout because they're already from semi-famous wealthy families (wine merchants? Landlords? A little of both?) and will inherit family riches and business, where for Noam the fame and the access through the art is his only security. But maybe he's also in it for the art for his mom? He doesn't like to think about it too much, but the band broke up when he felt like the others weren't talking it as seriously add he needed, and he kind of hates rich prep school kids (and probably did the whole time). And the branching out into rogue class is also about diversifying his skill sets because even though he won't admit it out loud or even to himself, maybe the art isn't going to carry him as high or as long as he needs.
