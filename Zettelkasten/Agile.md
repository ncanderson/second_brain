# Agile
Agility - ability to react to volatility.
**VUCA**
V - Volatility
U- Uncertainty
C - Complexity
A - Ambiguity

Risk reduction. Successful = all features, high quality, on time, on budget

## Lean
- Assume all projects will be built again.
- Maximize value while minimizing waste
- Lean is the practice of experimentation to achieve perfect value with zero waste
- Creating more value with fewer resources
#### Purpose
Correctly specify the value the customer seeks
#### Process
Once purpose is clarified, focus on the process
#### People
Make someone responsible for each value stream

### Seven Wastes of SW Dev
1. Extra features
2. Requirements
3. Extra Steps
4. Finding Information
5. Defects not caught by tests
6. Waiting, delays, including customers
7. Handoffs

## Kanban
A visual signal used to trigger an action
A means to design, manage and improve flow systems for knowledge work

### Kanban vs. Scrum

| Method | Board | Team | Planning | Working |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kanban | Persistant, shared | Specialists allowed, no roles prescribed | Focus on lead time, est. is optional | Priorities can change, work is batched |
| Scrum | Reset each sprint, single team| Cross-functional, specific roles | Velocity, est. prescribed, sprints timeboxed | Priorities only change between sprints, work is batched |

## Agile
Mindset defined by values, guided by principles, manifested through communities with limitless practices.
- Move quickly and easily
- Think/understand quickly

### Agile Teams
Cross-functional, work together to design and build the solution the customer needs, ideally not requiring anyone outside the team.

#### Epics:
- as a tourist I want a nice place to stay
- as a captain I want a dock
- as a fisher I want a deep sea excursion
- as the mayor I want an airport
- as a tourist I want a nice restaurant
- as a contractor I want a hospital

### Questions
- 'Agile waterfall' -
- Requirements that later prove to be poorly thought out - managing waste from the client
- Kaisan in the context of manufacturing

### Thoughts
- How to change our OPENSEA team meetings to save people time - does it make sense to attempt an agile methodology for a large team that isn't sharing any goals.
- Remove the backlog if we aren't going to do that
- Prune personal backlog?
- How to minimize meetings
