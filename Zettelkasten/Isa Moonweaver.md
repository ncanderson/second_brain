# Isa Moonweaver
Heya—here is what I’ve come up with for my character.  I’m imagining MacGyver mixed with Mary Poppins, but just coming of age....so add in an unhealthy amount of “Pollyanna”.  

Isa Moonweaver  
- [[Moon Elf]], 99 yrs old, cusp of adulthood, she/her  
- 5ft tall, fat, and generally good natured (hint of chaos of course). Icy blue skin with hair that changes daily (something to do with the knitting needles that are generally stored in Isa’s hair when not in use.  The knitting needles are her arcane focus and a gift from her grandmother, [[Louisa Carolina Moonweaver]] - was thinking that I’d make a list and roll for hairstyle after a long rest.). Wears lots of beautifully crafted leather over fine clothing, a bandolier of potion bottles, well worn boots, and a growing assortment of intricate, small inventions hooked on her belt; within her satchel is a collection of useful parts, plant/animal matter and many unidentifiable bits.  
- Louisa Carolina is 500+ years old, a leader and generally awesome person who hasn’t left home since the moon fell.  A crafty witch who fought bravely in the great battle and whose heart has never recovered from the immense losses.  She has debilitating anxiety...it is rare for her to venture out of their estate.  After the great battle, she gathered together as many elves and any others who wished to follow and made their way back to...insert lore.  I’d imagine they’d choose a place that had some about of surviving forest...or maybe they are well off because their homeland survived?  
- Isa was raised by her grandmother, which is fairly common among their people  
- Isa’s mothers are adventurers—[[Birel Moonweaver|Birel]] and [[Lia Moonweaver|Lia]].  They call on Isa’s birthday, fairly secretive about where they are/what they are up to.  Isa is ok with this arrangement, loves them and does not feel neglected. She has not seen them in years, though...the last time she saw them, they gifted her a 2 headed [[Trout|magical worm named Trout]]. Isa treats Trout as a trusted confidant and dearly loves them, though they do literally nothing but wiggle. Trout lives in a small wooden box with a ceramic bottom.  Under the ceramic bottom is where Isa keeps her family’s signet ring and a small scroll from her grandmother that she is only to open in the most dire of circumstances.  Isa has no idea what the scroll is and hopes to never find out.  
- While Isa’s main passion is inventing, she spent time in her 50s with the [[Liadon family]], distant relatives who were druids and learned about plants and their many useful properties.  Isa utilizes many plants in her concoctions and retains a love of nature at the chemical property level.  During this time, Isa’s cousin [[Rolen Liadon]] lived with and learned from Louisa Carolina.  Rolen and Isa maintain contact and have a deep friendship, albeit a competitive one.  
- Isa’s inventions have mostly been small up to this point, but they all contain a small speck of the moon.  Easy to find if you know what to look for.  Her family has sworn to keep the moon shining; this is her way of honoring that promise. (I don’t really have a strong desire to include much religion, beyond a true devotion to the moon...whatever that means.  I think I have such an aversion to religion, that I’ve not figured out how to play it for fun.  Game to keep trying, but need an easy gimmick or something to build off of.)  
- It is tradition for Moon Elves to venture out into the world alone to gain acceptance as an adult.  For Isa, this doesn’t mean without some assistance.  Her passage was paid for in full by Louisa Carolina, and she was given gorgeous scale mail that has certainly never seen battle.  She was also made to promise to sending stone home with updates of her adventures.  
- Isa is quite naive, but excited to venture out.  An avid learner, they hope to widen their grasp on alchemy and experience ‘earning a wage’ for the first time.  
  
Hopes:  
- A system for inventing, both mundane and magical, mechanical and alchemical. How do I move from idea through failure to a possible success?  I get magical tinkering at level 1 (and alchemist is the subclass I’ll be choosing at lvl 3), but I’d want to grow that list of possibilities as I learn/experiment/level up.  Certainly something that would be a downtime activity (Mary Poppins trait), but also on the spot (the MacGyver trait).
