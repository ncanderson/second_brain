# Euler angles
Angles describing the offset between two frames of reference. The angles between the 'matching' dimensions (ie Z - z, X - x, Y - y).

We have the fixed (Earth) frame, and something that maintains its own frame of reference. Euler angles describe the offsets between them, for each dimension.

Angles denoted as alpha (a), beta (B), gamma (y), or psi, theta, phi.
