## Notes
Database notes, from F5

Desire to change pcomms to static types.
number validation?
some sort of id from a status based on a user?

preference for defined LCM types vs PCOMMS so the messages can be tracked better. For example, camera_cmd_t that has fields for pan, tilt and zoom

how do we know that a command was successful?
Create a 'log' that retains all LCM commands?
F5 wants to know if a command was succesful. Can we just log Pcomms commands and pub them back out?
