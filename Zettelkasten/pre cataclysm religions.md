[[Magic]] and divinity are very closely linked in [[Oskora]]. The power of magic, for those who can access it, flows from a number of Realms, or [[Hold|Holds]]. They each bear an aspect, and within each are a number of positions conforming to a loose structure. The holders of these positions, named below, are mortals who have ascended, and in doing so, gained the power of a [[Gods|god]]. 

Each of these holds has a physical reality, and they can be visited. Not all are safe for denizens of the material world, indeed, some would likely mean instant death. 

Those who are able to access the power of the holds directly can wield awesome magical power, but the gods also reward the faithful with a measure of that same power. Often called [[The Concordat]], a god needs to share its power, for a god that has no worshippers slips into obscurity, and if that deity holds a position in one of the holds, it is vulnerable to usurpation.
