# post cataclysm calendar
Many cultures used a lunar calendar. When the moon was destroyed, it necessitated a new conception of what a year meant. Despite the fact that solar calendars were dominant prior to the [[Star Fall]], lunisolar calendars have risen to prominence in many places. This is in part related to the adoption of such a calendar in [[Obraria]], as their role in trade and ocean transportation served as a major unifying force post-cataclysm.

A year is 273 solar days, 10 lunar months of 27 days. Each lunar month is divided into 4 6-day weeks (24 days). The first day of the month is known as the day of departure, when the loss of the full moon is grieved. The last two days of the month are known as a time of preparation leading to the day of departure. The second-to-last day of the month was known as the Watch. Traditionally, a representation of the lost moon would be placed in a prominent place in a house or place of worship. It was a solemn day, when speaking was discouraged until after sunset, when women of the community would lead ritual keening. This would lead to a party, with drink, dancing and music in celebration of what the moon provided. The last day of the month was a time of rest, often referred to as The Rest. Traditionally, people would start to gather in mid morning (it varied, but since the night before was generally a time for celebration it was rarely early in the morning), and by early afternoon would process to a high place, or at least a clearing, where a good view of the night sky was possible. Torches would be lit, songs would be sung, and while the event was generally celebratory, the presence of clergy was more pronounced. The drinking, eating, song and dance tended to be focused, though rituals differed in different communities. Children conceived on this day were considered lucky, and some communities would have contests to see who could concieve of the most children on such a day (how that was determined to be the case is up for some debate). In warmer months, many would sleep under the starts. In colder, it was common to retreat to a communal space and spend the rest of the night in community. The first day of the month was a time of reflection. There would often be sermons (depending on the tradition). The wearing of white was common, and the offering of sacrifices for the return of the moon.

Since there isn't actually a moon any more, this lunar cycle is maintained by counting, which is an important role as they are seen as people who maintain this link with past.

A full [[Shafiran Cycle]] is 32 years. Every 10 years in the [[Shafiran Cycle]], there is the intercalation of a full month. This month is generally a time of celebration, and usually will coincide with the harvest and is prepared for in advance. (these are called embolismic months).  

The 32nd year has an extra 13 days added to achieve synchronization. This is considered an extra special time, and some hold that this period contains powerful magic. Additionally, the 31st and 32nd years are thought to be holy years, and many consider them to be the most sacred time in the cycle.


#### Math
273 days x 32 years in the cycle = 8736 days in the cycle
27 x X = 8736
X = 323.55 lunar months required to reach synchronization
32 years of 10 lunar months = 320 lunar months per cycle, 3.5 months short of the 323.5 months needed to achieve synchronization.
