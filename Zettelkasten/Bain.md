A dwarf of [[Ranra Hirca]]

Bain's story:
"It started simply enough on [[Ranra Hirca]]. [[Crivnux]] was just an ambassador from [[New Gerngarum|Gerngarum]] (the 'New' is his affectation) and old [[King Dolmund]]. It started innocuously enough. Despite all our efforts on Hirca over the centuries, there were always individuals that weren't satisfied with our life there. Whether avarice, jealously or just anger, we would support and accommodate them - [[Tupac]] could speak more to that. 

There is a long tradition of patronage among dwarves - our clan structure isn't a family in the strictly hereditary sense, and allows for adoptions and inductions, which normally strengthen the bonds of our society. Using what I can only assume is Gerngarum Gold, Crivnux gave a voice to the dissatisfied dwarves of Hirca, and they in turn used the tradition of patronage to forge new bonds. By the time any of us knew what was going on, we found ourselves lost among our own clans; bonds of kinship had shifted, and most of the clans were split. A new order had emerged faster than anyone could figure out what was going on.
 
We find ourselves now in a difficult situation. Most of the clans hesitate to act, unsure whether their members will cleave to old allegiances or flock to the banners of these 'New Dwarves'. I myself am in an awkward position. I am not authorized to speak for Hirca as a whole, but I am here to do what I can to secure Ranra Hirca's diplomatic future in New Gerngarum, since we now find ourselves in its orbit. 

The trouble is, I find it hard to know where I myself stand. Crivnux has been ruthless, none would deny it. I don't know if Hirca's traditions can survive the reality we now find ourselves in. But when I look to the future that New Gerngarum, I feel something that I've never felt before. We had it easy on Hirca for centuries, but elsewhere, across the continent, dwarves have been embattled, besieged and losing ground. It's no wonder so many dwarves praise martial prowess; to let slip the axe for even a moment has been the death of many dwarf holds. The folks I have met who arrive in New Gerngarum, swelling with hope for a future that isn't soaked in blood, have made me wonder if Hirca's isolation has been irresponsible and short-sited. 

Please don't think I've forsaken our traditions - I cling to them as tightly as ever, and if I can throw off Crivnux's yolk, I will in a second. But I'm not sure anymore if I want to abandon the idea of New Gerngarum."
