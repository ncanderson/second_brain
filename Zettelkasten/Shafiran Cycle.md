# Shafiran Cycle
A period of 32 years. After 32 years, lunar phases recur at the same time of year (according to the solar calendar). 

Named after [[Shafira]], a scholar of [[Baisteirano]]. The cycle was calculated as a means to rectify the lunar cycle of the now-destroyed moon with the solar year. Used in many calendars after the [[Star Fall]], notably in [[Obraria]] where the cycle formed the basis of the calendar that found wide-spread adoption.
