# Griss' Family
Griss' family has arrived on a new continent, looking for business opportunities. They have been casting a wide net and have discovered two possibilities:
- [[Cure Tue]] seems interested in the possibility of a foreign merchant family, unconnected to the politics of [[Ond SÃ¢liya]].
- [[The Necromancer]] who the [[Blue Faces]] seek to discredit is holed up in a noble family's compound. [[The local priest]] is rumored to have expensive tastes which could be supplied by this new mercantile venture.
