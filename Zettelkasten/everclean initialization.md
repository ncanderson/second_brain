# [[everclean]] initialization
- It's all on on 22.04
- Created two repos:
	- https://github.com/gsiq-everclean/gss_ec_coverage
	- https://github.com/gsiq-everclean/ec_db_scripts

### Projects
- `project_everclean_v1` is the subsea project
- `project_everclean_topside` is topside
> you require nothing from subsea from a database perspective (very much so by design) (scott H.)

### Startup
- Build/pull a container for ec base or whatever
- Spend a little time figuring out how to use qt creator inside a running docker container
- Install it all, start work on database standup
- Incorporate Brian's notes into the pg database
- Get access to a log
- Start scripting I guess
