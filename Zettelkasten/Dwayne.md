# Dwayne
Cleric devoted to [[Vorphos]].

Dwayne has been intrigued with [[Liradel Indris]] from the moment she was released from the ring, despite nearly being killed by her. He has held an earnest desire to aid in the healing process and restoration of her power and purpose. 

Prior to meeting or knowing anything about her, Dwayne had been dabbling in the dark arts of shadow magic/necromancy, to learn more of the relationship and connection between life and death. Feeling the power and design of her spellcraft, Dwayne's violent introduction to [[Liradel Indris]] drew him deeper into that curiosity and desire for understanding the deeper threads and connections of life and death. He then began to prepare more necromancy spells for his list which gave him a feeling of bonding to [[Liradel Indris]], feeling like she may notice energetically this discipline of his. That it may bring more trust and perhaps someday open her to teaching Dwayne ways of the dark arts and helping to map pathways between life and death.

Her willingness to help the party in time of great need (Tarrasque) felt like progress to Dwayne. Her power, even in a still-weakened-state, was a wonder to behold and her trust and sacrifice was deeply appreciated. 

Dwayne is in awe and endlessly fascinated by [[Liradel Indris]], perhaps more than he once was with [[Vorphos]]. 

I'm wondering if they might forge a relationship to create some sort of new and more intentional synergy between the holds of life and death. Perhaps they will trade seats so [[Liradel Indris]] can more easily heal and regain power from the hold of life and the opening of new spells and energies, while Dwayne delves into darkness combining those spells and energies with his tools of life to become an ever more powerful god, with mutual support and respect from/with [[Liradel Indris]].

I share these seeds with you, not knowing what may come of it...
