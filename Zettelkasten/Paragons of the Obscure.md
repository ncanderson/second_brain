# Paragons of the Obscure
A [[post cataclysm religions|post cataclysm religion]].

## Overview  
**Type**: monolatry

**Name for clergy**: sage  
**Place of worship**: college  
**Founder**: Sul Ahman  
  
## Nature of the Divine  
In monaltry, the religion's practitioners consider only one god worthy of worship but acknowledge that there might be other gods out there. In this case, they worship one they call Lady Winter and they depict Lady Winter as a flock of moths, which is meant to be metaphorical. Lady Winter is said to command the beasts of the wild.  
  
## Meaning of Life  
According to this tradition, the great problem which besets the world and the mortals in it is living an inauthentic life. The only solution to this problem is making one's own meaning, which all of their religious practices and beliefs are directed towards.  
  
## Clergy and Places of Worship  
Each community has and maintains its own college, where practitioners gather for worship. The college has an interplay of light and dark spaces, lit with candles or lanterns but also filled with burning incense.  
Larger regions also have an academy to which practitioners sometimes make pilgrimage.  
This religion does not have fixed clergy, but sages wander from place to place, where they defend community members in civil courts,act as mediators for conflicts in the community,and lead practitioners in meditation. These sages rely on their own wisdom, charisma, or power for their authority. They cannot marry and they take vows of celibacy. Colleges are maintained by a hired college-keeper, who is technically a minor order of clergy.  
  
## Practices and Beliefs  
Practitioners go on monthly parades through their local community,and attend morning worship each week in the college.  
Tradition is passed down through carefully memorized songs and ballads.  
Famously, members of this religion are strict vegetarians unless they are served meat when they are guests. There is also some controversy regarding this religion's attempts to make everyone else follow their rules.  
  
## History  
This religion is notably revivalist. Centuries ago Sul Ahman built a great college, establishing this religion as a real power, but the college was destroyed and the tradition languished in almost complete obscurity for centuries until about two generations ago, when Sul Ahman's wisdom was rediscovered.  
In recent years, they have had some conflict with a neighbouring religion that claims they worship demons. Indeed, many of the legends, symbols, and language relating to this religion do resemble those for the demons of the neighbouring religion.
