As the sun dips below the Horseshoe mountains, a whisper of cool settles in. The dense canopy spreading out like a jeweled carpet at the base of the mountains releasing a wisp of fog, and the forest seems to hold its breath for a moment, until the mournful call of a night-stalking raptor pierces the air.

Far away lies, [[Ond SÃ¢liya]], that city of many faces. A jewel by the ocean, redolent with spice and salt air. A paradise of sun and sea. A city of excitement and danger, heavy with home-grown and imported conflicts. A miserable prison where no-hopers and last-chancers toil in despair. A muculent stew that clings to the clothes (and the soul) and is slow in letting go. 

Since sun-down, little has changed in the [[Salty Badger]]. Nestled between weaver's shops on a quiet side-street some distance from the harbor, the greying wood of the facade seems to droop, but is clean and well kept. A bit too from anything else to be a destination for rowdier elements, by day the establishment does a decent trade for the hard working craftspeople of the neighborhood.

Many of them firmly ensconsed since early afternoon, the nighttime regulars settle in for another night of quiet contemplation. Tired eyes trace the courses of familiar wooden tables, as if the grain holds a map to escape, redemption, to *something*. The music has been a relatively recent addition (no one here could tell you how long), and though it has done little to lift the spirits of this assembled crowd, there have been fewer fights at closing time. As the music fades and a desultory applause dies down to a glacial silence, the proprietor [[Lorch]] brings a small meal of fish stew and dense bread made from the local grain over to the makeshift stage in the corner.

"I think they really liked that last one" he says amiably, setting the bowl and a mug of the sour, watery local ale down on table next to the musician. "I think I even saw a few of them tapping their toes."
