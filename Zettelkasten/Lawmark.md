# Lawmark
Neighborhood of [[Ond Sâliya]].

Rumored to be the home of a monstrous, sentient plant that disguises itself as an old man and occasionally snatches people from the street. See also [[Star Spawn]] and [[The Old Man of Lawmark]].

[[Ond Sâliya]] is built over ancient [[Yuan Ti]] ruins ([[Ond Sâliya Pits]]), and this neighborhood is the only known place to access them. These ruins have been colonized by a malicious plant, and is a convienent way for authorities to dispose of unwanted people.
