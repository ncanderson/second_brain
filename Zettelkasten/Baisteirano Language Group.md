# Baisteirano Language Group
Note that this language group has been constructed with no work being done regarding movements of people, invasions, cultural dominance, etc. since the initial spread of Baisteirano across this continent.

Since the rise of humans on [[Oskora]] ([[Leasian|Leasian's Issue]] and all that), humans spread south from [[Oskora]] to [[Sheakroth]]. The open plans and easy access to shipping lanes meant a free flow across the continent, with the exception of the [[Bengo Language Group]]. The mountains on the eastern edge of [[Sheakroth]] meant those languages developed in isolation from the rest of the continent, save for the influence of elven traders from [[Oskora]].
