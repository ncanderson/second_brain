**Raw:**
Appearance: Jareth is a striking figure, with a lean build and angular features. He has long, wild hair that is as black as a starless night, and his eyes gleam like diamonds. He dresses in a style that is both elegant and theatrical, with a wardrobe that includes tight-fitting pants, billowy shirts, and a plethora of jackets and coats.

Personality: Jareth is a powerful and mysterious Fey, who is both captivating and enigmatic. He is a master of illusion and manipulation, and he enjoys playing games with the mortals he encounters. He is fiercely independent, and he views the world as his playground. He is not above using his powers to bend others to his will, but he is not inherently evil. He is more interested in his own amusement than causing harm.

Motivations: Jareth's motivations are complex and not easily understood by mortals. He takes an interest in certain individuals that catch his eye, and he sees granting them power as a way to make their lives more interesting. He enjoys the thrill of playing with their fates, and he views their struggles as a form of entertainment. He chooses the gnome librarian as his warlock because he sees something unique and special in them, and he is intrigued by their love for knowledge and their desire to uncover the secrets of the world.

Pact: The warlock who makes a pact with Jareth gains access to a wide range of magical abilities, including illusions, mind control, and teleportation. Jareth's warlock can use these abilities to deceive and manipulate their enemies, but they must be careful not to get too caught up in their own games and lose sight of what is truly important. In return for their power, Jareth requires that the warlock entertain him with their adventures and take on challenges that he sets for them. He may also occasionally ask for a small task or favor in return for his gifts.

In conclusion, Jareth is a powerful and unpredictable patron who offers a wide range of abilities in return for a warlock's loyalty, entertainment and also will to be his pawn or toy on his own amusement. However, He is not evil, and he only wants to make the warlock's life more exciting and adventurous.

Jareth may be interested in supporting the warlock's research for several reasons. Here are a few possibilities:

-   Jareth may be interested in knowledge and learning himself. Although he is a Fey and may have access to ancient and powerful magic, he may still find the pursuit of knowledge and understanding to be fascinating. By supporting the warlock's research, he may be satisfying his own curiosity as well as the warlock's.
    
-   Jareth may see the warlock's research as a way to entertain himself. The warlock's pursuit of knowledge and discovery may be an intriguing game or puzzle for Jareth to solve. He may enjoy the challenge of guiding the warlock on their journey of discovery and helping them to uncover new and interesting information.
    
-   Jareth may be interested in helping the warlock to unlock their full potential. By supporting the warlock's research, he may be helping them to gain new insights and understanding that will allow them to use their powers more effectively. He may see this as a way to make their adventures more exciting and entertaining.
    
-   Jareth may have a hidden interest or a personal motivation for wanting a specific knowledge to be uncovered. He might be searching for a specific artifact, history or magic that the warlock might stumble upon in his journey.
    

It's worth noting that since Jareth is characterized as a mysterious and complex individual, his motivations may not always align with the warlock's and his choices may not be immediately clear or predictable. But one thing is certain, Jareth's ultimate goal is always his own amusement and fun, and as long as he's entertained by the warlock's journey he will keep supporting them.

As Jareth is a fictional character that I created, I don't have a definitive answer as to what his specific hidden motivation might be. However, here are a few possibilities:

-   Jareth may be searching for a way to defeat an ancient enemy or rival. He may believe that the information the warlock uncovers in their research could help him gain an advantage in this conflict.
    
-   Jareth may be searching for a lost artifact or powerful magic that he believes will give him greater power or prestige. He may believe that the warlock's research will lead them to this item, and he is using the warlock as a means to obtain it.
    
-   Jareth may have a connection to the warlock's family or people. He may have a history with the warlock's ancestors and is now seeking to help them uncovering their past.
    
-   Jareth may be experimenting with the warlock to see how they react to different challenges and situations. He might be trying to understand the warlock's abilities and limitations better, and use this knowledge to improve the warlock's combat prowess or test the warlock's loyalty.
    

Keep in mind that these are all speculative, Jareth's motivations are ultimately left for a game master to decide and elaborate, but it would be interesting for the warlock to have a personal quest to uncover the true reasons behind Jareth's interest in them.

In the movie Labyrinth, Jareth the Goblin King, is the main antagonist and his motivations are somewhat different than the one I have described earlier.

Jareth is the ruler of the Goblin Kingdom and is initially portrayed as a power-hungry and narcissistic ruler who is determined to keep his subjects in line and prevent them from leaving his realm. He is also a master of illusions and manipulation, and he enjoys playing games with the mortals he encounters.

Jareth's motivations in the movie revolve around Sarah, the protagonist, whose baby brother he steals at the beginning of the movie in response to her selfish wishes, believing that her desire to be free from the baby is sincere, Jareth see's the opportunity to challenge her to retrieve the baby by going into his labyrinth and solves its puzzle within 13 hours. As Sarah proceeds on her quest to retrieve her baby brother, Jareth starts to develop an interest in her, seeing her as a kindred spirit, both are lonely individuals who desire to be free from the responsibilities they have.

Jareth's actions are driven by a desire to be loved, respected, and adored by those around him. He wants to be the center of attention and the most important person in Sarah's life, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. He is willing to manipulate and deceive her in order to win her love and affection. In the end, as Sarah manages to solve the labyrinth and reach her baby brother, Jareth makes a last desperate move and tries to seduce Sarah with a romantic song, offering her to stay in the Labyrinth and rule by his side, but Sarah resists and he ultimately lets her go and sends her and her brother back home.

So in the movie, Jareth's motivations were a mix of power, loneliness, and a desire for love and connection, Jareth was a complex character who had multiple layers and was not just an outright villain, but rather a tragic one.

Can you give me a list of names for fae creatures?
