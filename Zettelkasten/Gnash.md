## Background

First memories are of being surrounded by humans that did not like me, including my “parents”, in a small, remote village in Northern [[Questan]] by the [[Frothwrath River]]. I look back now and realize they were probably not my parents. I learned to cook, clean, weave, sew...and how to protect myself. My only connection was with a dwarven trader named [[Gord]] and their horse [[Zork]]. Gord would hire me to care after Zork during their stay. Zork and I talked of their long travels and I grew to trust the trader. It was from Gord that I learned I was a tiefling—most likely why I could talk with Zork. It had always felt important to hide my gifts...fear of greater retribution or something more creative.

I left my village at a very early age, angry and reckless...the only thing I missed was the semi-regular visits with Gord and Zork. Maybe our paths will cross again.

I lived alone and found solace in nature. There are [[Frothwrath River|sulphurous hot springs]] that would probably melt a humans skin off; I felt safe there, near the water, in a spot I knew humans did not care for. I found friendship in any animal that would talk with me and did everything I could to protect my new family. Killing hunters came easy. Once I found a wolf cub in a trap. I don’t think I ate any of the hunter, but after looking at what was left of him...I’m not sure. Eh. My horn had been severed during the fight, otherwise I was fine. Felt good to be strong and felt good to kill to keep the pup safe. I brought the pup back to its pack and explained what had happened. I offered my services as hunter killer and enjoyed a few years living as part of the pack. They called me Gnash and called me pack.

As I grew, I started to wander further and wonder about the rest of the world; decided it was time to move on. By that time, I had gained quite a lot of wolfiness. It showed in my emotions, body movements, and I’d come to be covered in a fine, soft fur. I was gifted the claws of the most recent past elder wolf, said to offer guidance and luck of the pack. I immediately braided them into my hair, weeping, cuddle puddled with the whole pack. In my preparations, I made a new set of leather clothing to fit my new height and a cape that I’d woven from gathered wolf fur. My pack would indeed keep me safe.

I made my way north to the sea following the Frothwraith. As I crested the final rise, I saw the harbor of [[Wrathton]]. Remembering stories from Gord, intrigued, I set my course. Appropriately enough, I found work on the [[Howling Storm]], a large seaworthy shipping vessel.

The crew was a bit put off by me and very wary. Most folks I met seemed to keep their distance. But, [[Captain Rafe]] didn’t let the crew treat me poorly and soon I was accepted...or they were thrown over. I appreciated the support and grew to love being a sailor, both the sailing and the camaraderie with the crew...good to see the good of humans. Practiced fighting with word and muscle, giving and taking beatings; I’d found another pack. Found I was good at working in the rigging as my tail served to keep me stable and leave my hands free for work. Some days I’d be aloft all day, talking to the birds about their lives and the weather, keeping look out, and took to hollowing out my severed horn into a not very passable music maker.

One day in port (which port?), Captain Rafe asked for the horn and I feared the worst, but gave it over. A few days later, he presented the horn back to me...a masterpiece. He’d taken it to some tinkerer and they’d finished hollowing it out and added a few holes and a silver band that allowed it to attach to the stub on my head. 

That day we set sail on a month long journey, carrying (what would we be carrying that was worth A LOT?) to (where?). Half way into the journey, the wind shifted...and died. It was like no sound carried. Within seconds, we were foundering under an unseen weight, followed quickly by a fiery explosion. On fire, I was thrown from the rigging into the sea and watched, unable to move, as a vessel appeared, boarded and slaughtered any left alive. The last thing I remember before passing out was the sight of the flag: (what pirates are known here? Pretty powerful ones.). After I woke the next day, I found myself floating with barely a remnant of the Howling Storm and not a single body beyond mine. Thoughts of vengeance, and passing dolphins, kept me alive. I plan to rip their faces off and leave them to be devoured alive by any creature that would like a free meal.

I don’t remember much from those days, beyond being passed nose to nose, closer to the shore. I kept to myself for years, only venturing out to connect with folk when I feared my mind might not be able to muster language if not put to practice. I now spend time searching out magical weapons and spells to aid in my preparation for revenge...it has been slow going, while at the same time, looking for my next pack.
