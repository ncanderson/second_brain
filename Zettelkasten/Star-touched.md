When the [[Great Comet Storm]] struck the world and triggered the [[Cataclysm]], many people died immediately. Many who found themselves, by choice or necessity, living near places where comet fragments struck. Those that were not killed immediately often found themselves transformed.

Sickly purplish tinge to skin of people, many wearing large, ragged robes.
