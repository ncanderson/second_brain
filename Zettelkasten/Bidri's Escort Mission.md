# Bidri's Escort Mission

# Story
[[Bidri]] asks the party to escort something to the [[Lumber Camp]] in the jungle. On the surface, this is a shipment of old clothes that are being sent out for donation to the people at the lumber camp (which hopefully appears to be a flimsy cover). Hidden within the cart is a small locked box. Offers 60gp each for the job.

#### Theme
The players realize there is more going on that meets the eye.

#### Goal
Bring a cart through the jungle to the [[Lumber Camp]] and return to tell the tale. This will prove the party's mettle and potentially lead to more work from [[Bidri]].

#### Story Hook
[[Bidri]] offers the group a source of regular employment. Hoping to work the angle against [[Noam]] by promising to introduce him to some important local talent scouts.

#### Plot

#### Climax
The party discovers that there is some sort of demonic force at work.

#### Secret Weakness

# Setting	

#### General Setting
Beginning at [[The Rotten Horse]], moving through the jungle towards the [[Lumber Camp]], ending TBD.

#### Specific Setting I
A bridge that is being guarded by a troll, to whom the goblins are delivering supplies. Can be reached via a path that the players might notice on a DC 15 perception check. 

#### Specific Setting II
A dim ruin, where a demonic captain is hiding out. This entity seems to be locked in a trance and is unresponsive. A number of sigils adorn

# Foes	
#### Master Villain
Thrall of [[Kaz'gadoth]], a captain under the thrall of [[Kaz'gadoth]], who ultimately serves [[Fraz Urb'luu]] through several layers of hierarchy. This was a person who attempted to run away from the lumber camp but was possessed by a minor demon named [[Kaz'gadoth]]. Mostly unresponsive, moves in a jerky manner. If the the spell is somehow broken, the body will die.

In the presence of this thrall, the air grows thick, and a buzzing begins the fill the ears of the people.

#### Minor Villain I
[[Klash]] - a troll who is under the thrall of [[Kaz'gadoth]]. Often falls into a rage, but won't leave the area of the bridge.

#### Minor Villain II
Some goblins:

[[Gorgran]]  
[[Borkoth]]
