# The Ancient Ones
6 mysterious figures who created a plane of existence, and bound within it great defenders ([[Planar Defender]]) to provide a means for the plane to protect itself.

Long they built, creating universes, but their actions attracted the timeless, chaotic attention of beings from beyond even their infinity, who began to pursue the creations and topple them. 

By creating the [[Hold|Holds]], The Ancient Ones thought they could protect this last plane by binding with champions.
