# Griss
not looking to steal trade secrets of the family, buuuut has probably heard all sorts of business development conversations and plan-making - family has a ton of hubris from surviving the cataclysm on a sort of advantageous foot and want to shore up their achievements and try to recession-proof themselves, pretty darn mercilessly.

when gris receives word of the family reaching [[Eukarth|eukarth's]] shores - the when/how/where of it - gris will have an 'oh no' moment realizing which of their plans they have put into action and the dire outcomes that will result.

gris childhood: literally a [[half-elf]] bastard and kinda pushed to the side - there are legitimate half-siblings being prepared for leadership in the family business  
  
gris made themselves useful, however, and showed a natural aptitude for seafaring, etc. - and things seemed to go better overall when gris hid the ears and claimed to be a distant relation.  
  
gris was given vessels and trading voyages to lead and had they continued to stay in line, could probably have reasonably expected to eventually run the family's business presence in a far-flung port.  
  
having been privy to all sorts of unsavory 'business development' conversations, plans, and tactics over the years, gris realized it was going to be impossible to enjoy their relative distance from the muck for much longer -  
  
the family's business 'practices' were not to gris's liking, however, and they continued to keep a low profile and stick to just running successful ships.  
  
but that simply 'opting out' would be seen as a threat and a liability, and gris would be sent to sleep with the fishes.  
  
so gris sailed as far as possible, well out of the reach and influence of the family business - or so they had hoped. :(  
  
if not for the debt situation upon landing, gris would've been best-served as an independent captain-for-hire for trade that wasn't heading back to the homeland, or moving inland and running a sweet riverboat operation (maybe - seems kinda weird though).  
  
*** feel free to invent a family name and siblings and whatever level of unsavory trade/business that fits your worldbuild! :)  
  
** family isn't evil for the fun of it, they're fear-motivated from their slim survival of the previous cataclysm event,  
  
and having found themselves on an somewhat advantageous footing afterwards, are working to shore up their achievements and try to recession-proof themselves, pretty darn mercilessly. lots of hubris :) lol  
  
yes human! i'm the grandkid of the founder/person in charge - one of their kids was some sort of black sheep/wayward adventurer that managed to whelp on an elf at some point
