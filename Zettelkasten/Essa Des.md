5 foot, skinny. Looks 19-ish.
Half Elf. Wearing 'distressed' clothing. Seems to be trying to blend in but it's a little too fine. 
A frantic, hungry look in their eye.

Interested in yelling.

## ENCLAVE
### Name
-   Bloomhaven

### Description
A planned community of predominantly half-elf druids–not unlike a cultish suburb–known to produce flowering plants for sale through a few limited contact points:
-   a small shop attached to the outside of the enclave walls
-   an exclusive to-order floral house, situated in a well-to-do neighborhood just inside the city proper, staffed by hired locals, managed by a few enclave (likely cabal) members

Sanctimonious adults cleave to a system of beliefs and practices that emphasizes ceaseless positivity, muted celebration, agreeable obedience, and ornamental flower gardening to support those needs of the enclave that can not be met by their own efforts.

### Streets/Trails/Locations

-   Placid Place
-   Pistil Plaza
-   Tranquility Terrace
-   Serenity Circle
-   Sweet Street
-   Bliss Boulevard

### CABAL - [[The Sepalcore]]
Most enclave members do not know that their community is a front for an entrenched cabal of druids who cultivate a wide variety of plants and fungi used in the production of dangerous potions and drugs, for sale to the highest bidders.

For the youth and majority of adult community members, their insular community is a place of light, goodness, and peace. They are mostly ignorant of what goes on outside their walls, and entirely in the dark regarding the cabal and it's dealings.

This cabal of powerful decision makers refer to themselves as the Sepalcore*. These Sepalcorers:
-   Manage the blackmarket finances of the enclave
-   Cultivate the secret crops
-   Arrange for the sale and distribution of their botanical products
-   Cultivate the next generation of cabal members

*Sepal: "The sepal consists of small leaves growing at the base of the petals. They protect the flowers before they bloom. The sepals also help hold the flowers in place on the plants.”

#### Cabal Terms
##### People
-   Petal Pushers - themselves
-   Vapid Glazers - unsuspecting adult members who serve as the smooth/polished face of the enclave in their limited contact with outsiders

##### Secret Subterranean Place Names
-   The Under Road
-   Dally Alley
-   Poison Place
-   Rotters Row

## ESSA FINDS, IS FOUND, & FLEES

During druidcrafting practice on their own, while trying to get flower buds to bloom, Essa instead accidentally caused the vines to rot/ disintegrate (half-formed chill touch or halo of spores?), revealing a hidden entrance to an old, underground chamber (prompted by intervention of some fungal network with its own agenda?).

In the chamber they discovered a dusty workshop, a neglected study, and the journals.

The journals detailed the formation of the enclave: the whispered discussions, heated debates, and clandestine machinations that culminated in the establishment of Bloomhaven. They also held records of the De Espora family name and historical connection to fungi and decay, rot and rebirth.

Over several weeks, Essa continued to sneak in to study the journals, druidcrafting the concealing vines back into place after each visit. In the time they spent pouring through the dusty tomes, they began to look around at the home they thought they knew, and feel a growing sickness in their belly; to look at adults they’d grown up around with suspicion - who were the wolves hidden amongst the sheep? Essa recalled conversations that had seemed innocent in recent months, and wondered if they had been on the list of potential initiates. Were they being groomed to join these monsters?

One night as they made their way to the hidden entrance, they were horrified to see several familiar faces exiting the workshop, tossing a small earthen jar through behind them. As acrid smelling wisps of gauzy smoke drifted out into the night from the underground workshop, Essa sneezed, and was seen.

Taking only what they had with them at the time, Essa ran to a spot they’d been eyeing on the wall where shelf mushrooms had created something like a ladder. Cursing and crying under their breath, they begged the fungi to bear their weight as they scrambled up, and then jumped down onto the canvas roof of the shop. They slid and fell and kept on running.
