# Essa Des
**Names**: 
- Caressa Fifoldara - birth name (old Saxon or Anglo-Saxon for ‘butterfly’)  
- Essa Despora (Essa Des) - chosen name

Is Essa OF the [[Star Spawn]]? The answer is yes.


**Description:**
- ~5’ tall  
- Olive complexion  
- Long dark hair  
- Perpetually furrowed brow  
- Periodically emerging/fading patterns on their skin (fungal filaments?)
- Skinny. Looks 19-ish.
- Wears 'distressed' clothing. Seems to be trying to blend in but it's a little too fine. 
- A frantic, hungry look in their eye.

**Personality:** 
- Recently shattered worldview  
- Growing into anger, expression of anger   
- Done with pathological optimism  
- Dismantling learned doctrines of universal morality  
- Anxious  
- Cautiously elated by the messiness and ambiguity of the world outside the enclave  
- Shocked by the suffering they encounter outside the enclave  
- Uncomfortable with exposing their skin (this was unusual among enclave residents - likely related to their spore markings)  
- Chose to use a variation of the family name they found in the old journals: (De Espora -> Despora -> Des), as a reminder of where they really come from  
- Naive as hell

**History:** During druidcrafting practice on their own, while trying to get flower buds to bloom, Essa instead accidentally caused the vines to rot/ disintegrate (half-formed chill touch or halo of spores?), revealing a hidden entrance to an old, underground chamber (prompted by intervention of some fungal network with its own agenda?). In the chamber they discovered a dusty workshop, a neglected study, and the journals. The journals detailed the formation of the enclave: the whispered discussions, heated debates, and clandestine machinations that culminated in the establishment of [[Bloomhaven]]. They also held records of the [[De Espora family]] name and historical connection to fungi and decay, rot and rebirth.  

Over several weeks, Essa continued to sneak in to study the journals, druidcrafting the concealing vines back into place after each visit. In the time they spent pouring through the dusty tomes, they began to look around at the home they thought they knew, and feel a growing sickness in their belly; to look at adults they’d grown up around with suspicion - who were the wolves hidden amongst the sheep? Essa recalled conversations that had seemed innocent in recent months, and wondered if they had been on the list of potential initiates. Were they being groomed to join these monsters? 

One night as they made their way to the hidden entrance, they were horrified to see several familiar faces exiting the workshop, tossing a small earthen jar through behind them. As acrid smelling wisps of gauzy smoke drifted out into the night from the underground workshop, Essa sneezed, and was seen. Taking only what they had with them at the time, Essa ran to a spot they’d been eyeing on the wall where shelf mushrooms had created something like a ladder. Cursing and crying under their breath, they begged the fungi to bear their weight as they scrambled up, and then jumped down onto the canvas roof of the shop. They slid and fell and kept on running.
