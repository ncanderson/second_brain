# Harold
If there is a Library at the Monastery "Harold Helruna" is there to study ancients lore and look for spells. He is also there (if there is no library) to collect spell components like pearls and seaweed. That's what he tells people. 

  

 The real reason he is there is he is constantly on the run from the agents known as "Iron Shadows" (Volo's pg 47), hobgoblin secret police.

  

 Harold Helruna was born into a fairly prominent hobgoblin family serving under a major warlord. His parents had great hopes for him, and his name means "Commander of the Hell Monster Army." Unfortunately for them, Harold wasn't born a "good" hobgoblin. His joy was always in books, organization and cleanliness. While serving as a common soldier, he quickly found his way into a position as a clerk. Once there, he happily crunched numbers, organized his desk and was a quiet disappointment to his parents. 

   One day while stacking books from a conquest, he came upon a series of book unlike any other he had seen before. There was a translation dictionary for learning Draconic, a theory on classifying the schools of magic, and a dusty spellbook. Harold, in what was the most rebellious moment of his life to that point, stole all three books. He hid them and studied them at night, slowly learning the simple spells. He would volunteer for late night sentry duty, or for solo patrols to uninhabited areas, and practice pronouncing then casting spells. 

    He had always known magic existed, but all Hobgoblin children are tested for the spark at a young age. They are then brought to the Academy of Devastation (Volo's pg 47) and trained in the evocation magic. They are tools of destruction. Harold faked stupidity during his own testing. This magic, these new magics, were amazing to him. They could build, protect, transmute substances and fool the eye. 

    Whenever his traveling Warlord's band conquered a new place, he would always carefully pick out books from libraries, town centers and monasteries to add to his carefully curated private collection. On the most recent raid, the people fled and holed up in a well fortified stone library protected by a wizard. The hobgoblins couldn't bust down the doors, so they left Harold's banner (family/ squadron) with a simple instruction: "Burn them out". As the soldiers began lobbing torches and flaming buckets of pitch onto the wooden roof, something in Harold snapped and he couldn't stand the destruction of so much information. He let forth a torrent of arcane magics and destroyed most of the hobgoblins that he had known his entire life. When the dust settled, only his younger brother remained. Harold couldn't bear to kill him, but left him unconscious on the ground. He was greeted as a hero by the people trapped in the library but told them only "wizard, give me your books, then take what books you can and flee this place with them." 

 Then he ran. 

 Now his is always one step ahead of the Iron Shadow and the Academy of Devastation, having shamed his family and with knowledge of hobgoblin military strategy. He only hopes one day he can be free of their grasp and find a sage place to practice his magic. His path has brought him to the island of monks, a place little known to others.
