# The Heresiarch
**Description:** (b. 851): Once a devout cleric serving under [[Rillendaris Ingoroma]]. He began to develop heretical beliefs based on the source of divine power. His teachings of ascetic contemplation and personal revelation. The Heresiarch organized a demonstration to show the strength of his piety. All of the faithful followers joined the Heresiarch in the main square of [[Gadliegh]], intending a ritual cutting of flesh to let the power of [[Kelrias]], the Priest of Life flow freely. [[Rillendaris]] and the [[Jurgis Abraitis|Old Duke]] sought to quell the dissent with the city guard. However, they misread the atmosphere of the gathering, which soon turned into a full-scale riot. [[Cafatia Thefrinal]], a young wizard, was able to use her arcane powers to put out the fires and minimize the loss of life. Fleeing to a network of tunnels near [[Gadliegh]], the Heresiarch and [[Rillendaris]] were able to achieve a truce, for the sake of preventing full-scale religious war.

The conflict with [[Rillendaris]] took place about 40 years prior to the Heresiarch meeting [[The Dianes]] in [[Old Gerngarum]].

The Heresiarch's faith held the moon in high regard.
