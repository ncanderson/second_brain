Capital: [[Merrowmeadow]]
Decentralized Elective Monarchy

### History 
City of Merrowmeadow rose to prominence in the region under the leadership of [[Tuvari Eilesa]] (770 - 822). She is regarded as the founder of the modern state of Questan. [[Eilesa]] and her children were responsible for pushing the borders of the city of Merrowmeadow to what is now the [[Marcher Forts]]. The cities of the region had long enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. Occasionally ambitious leaders would rise to prominence in the region, subjugating their neighbors and forming small states, but few were able to last.

### Relations
Limited access to waterways for trade mean somewhat tense relationships with [[Iolsos]] and [[Aenuch]]. [[Mala]], to the east, is a sparse, semi-arid land, with little profit passing in either direction. There is an area of disputed land south of the old [[Marcher Forts]], but neither side seems

### Economy
Qeustan's economy derives in a large part from trade. Straddling the [[Kielk River]] and bordering the [[Black Rabbit Steppe]], there good business in horses, wool and grain that is sent up river. Questan's neighbors to the north, [[Aenuch]], [[Nigad]] and [[Vani]], control access to the sea. Rather than pay the stiff tolls to move the goods all the way to the sea, much of the trade ends up in [[Aenuch]] and [[Iolsos]], which tends to benefit the merchants of those states at the expense of [[Questan]]. The lords of Merrowmeadow despite seeming externally rather poor, are able to draw on an unknown source of wealth, such that all attempts at rebellion have ended in ruin for the rebellious.

### Religion
The majority of people in the state of Questan follow the constellation of gods from the realm of Life, with a large minority giving devotion to the realm of Shadow.

### Famous people
[[Tuvari Eilesa]]: Founder of Qeustan. Born 770 in Merrowmeadow, middle daughter of a merchant family. Not interested in business, she spent much of her younger years wandering. In 790-92 she returned to Merrowmeadow with a large fortune and no explanation for how she had obtained it. That wealth saw her family rise to prominence, and her diplomatic and business skills saw her elected mayor of Merrowmeadow. On her ascension, wealth began to pour into Merrowmeadow, and with a combination of diplomacy, intrigue and war, she knit together a state in southern [[Oskora]] that has stood to this day.
