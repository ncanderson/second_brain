# DM Thoughts
Random thoughts about ways I'd like to run some games.
- Narrative-based roles. If there is a chance that a person *could* succeed at a role, they do it. The role determines what the consequences might be.

## Eukarth v2 Session 0 Notes
### Scheduling
- Lane: no tuesday
- Murphy: Wednesday leave montpelier by 8:30, every other week
- Looking like Thursday, possibly Wednesday for Murphy but not likely
- Limiting to 3 people for awhile.

### Lines/Veils
- Lines
  - Hurting/torturing helpless creatures

- Veils
  - Sexual violence
  - Lane - no zombie juice on them
 
- Not part of the game culture
  - Torture
  - Young women as character motivation
  - racism/homophobia implicit in the world

### Characters
#### Lane
Halfling bard, named Nome. Wants the fame and the money. Looks for a manager to try and get access to wealth. Songs get bottled somehow? Very young and very vain. Gone on tour 2 times. On a sabbatical, spent all his money to get to Eukarth. Who's the manager? Nome is looking for a specific person to multiclass as an assassin. 

#### Petra
Young adult, parents are druids, hippie nobility (like the board of the food coop). Liberal complacency. Character disgusted by the complacency and 'good vibes only' attitude. Pushing back against parents. Wants to study necromancy. 

#### Larkin
melee combat, otherworldly connectedness - like a seer. Create a map of the heavens, and include other planets and the gods.
