# Bidri
**Description:** Elf. Has plans in motion to usurp [[Cure Tue]]. Has a very close relationship with [[Geresta]].

**Personality:** 

**History:** Was saved by [[Lorch]]. He described he situation as overcome by grief: 

"We all of us are born with a yoke hanging around our necks. Grief and sorrow and the cares of living put weight on that yoke. It's enough to drown anyone, and there's no shaming folks who can't take it anymore. I think the longer-lived races must handle it differently somehow, but their long life can certainly lead to a heavier burden." 

She is reticent to discuss the event. Remains to be seen if she's even shared any of this with [[Geresta]].
