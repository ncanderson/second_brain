## Completed Tasks
Completed initial work to rectify the install targets. Now we have:
- buoy
- seco
- local
- remote
- replay

## Ongoing Tasks
Continuation of the _Tasks for Tomorrow_ section on [[2024-01-12]].
Friday:
- The buoy target would display the video streams locally, so there's only one workspace on the buoy, and one on the remote. 

- I think that the local target should have no workspace, but would need to trigger the autostart script via the desktop icon.
	- The .desktop will call `killall` then call the `local `autostart script.
- Then execute the killall script in `start_workspace_buoy`
Today:
- Buoy target has to call killall when workspace is started, then autostart buoy
- Local target has to call killall when it starts, and then autostart local
- Remote should function similarly to the old buoy

The [[workspace]] startup vertical:
- autostart script
	- consumes the process server config
- workspace .desktop
	- calls start_workspace
	- Workspace entry file
Targets:
buoy
- autostart: N/A - started when workspace is opened
- process server: buoy_process_server_config.yml
- .desktop: opt_mdas_workspace_buoy.desktop
- start_workspace: start_workspace_buoy.sh
- workspace config: opt_buoy_config.yml
> buoy should no longer autostart. local will be the default auto-start. Move 10start_workspace_buoy.sh to the bin directory, where it will be used by start_workspace_buoy.sh when workspace is opened. Has to run killall and then start_workspace_buoy.sh when workspace is opened.

replay
- autostart: N/A
- process server: N/A
- .desktop: opt_mdas_workspace_replay.desktop
- start_workspace: start_workspace_replay.sh
- workspace config: opt_replay_config.yml
> Good

seco
- autostart: 10start_workspace_seco.sh
- process server: seco_process_server_config.yml
- .desktop: opt_mdas_workspace_seco.desktop
- start_workspace: start_workspace_seco.sh
- workspace config: opt_seco_config.yml
> The workspace config is separate but just points at the same config as buoy/remote, so that's still sort of WIP but there isn't a plan yet.

local
- autostart: 10start_workspace_local.sh
- process server: local_process_server_config.yml
	- this also requires the ip address config stuff
- .desktop: opt_mdas_workspace_local.desktop
- start_workspace: N/A, .desktop calls the autostart script
- workspace config: N/A
> .desktop script now just calls the autostart script. This might not work :( because of perms on the autostart script.

remote
- autostart: N/A - process server starts from the .desktop
- process server: remote_process_server_config.yml
- .desktop: opt_mdas_workspace_remote.desktop
- start_workspace: start_workspace_remote.sh
- workspace config: opt_buoy_config.yml

Will still need to make any adjustments to the workspace config for the buoy install target video widgets

buoy: use IP directly from the devices
replay: no video streams
seco: no video streams
local: no workspace
remote: use separate IP addresses for the videos
## Tasks for Tomorrow
build and test the various install targets in the mio

## Blockers
