- Missing package for `tailscale` on a naked install of Ubuntu. ~~Probably need to do that `wget` command on this machine to see what we missed.~~ Found two missing debs, added them to the project. PR here: https://github.com/gsiq-bayonet/project_opt_mdas/pull/14

- When install `project_opt_mdas_base`, got this. We knew we needed to something about this file, this confirms. What's trying to copy this?
```bash
cp: cannot stat '3rd_party_licenses.csv': No such file or directory
```
- ~~Are we copying over 'last_installed'?~~ Yes we are, it 'just worked'
- Try to install the new project/project_base setup on a new VM and see if we're missing any tailscale debs for that. Provides a better indication of what we're missing as well.
- New key for mio, since I didn't back that up
