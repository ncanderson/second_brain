## Completed Tasks

## Ongoing Tasks
- review current db tables and determine how we'll get that data into tables
	- setup
		- new task for nav solution
		- copy existing infrastructure for nav solution into new application
		- add config to the project
	- code
		- helper function for timestamp_to_sample
		- split the nav solution out into position and attitude and insert
- This more about what states/tasks we actually need because this app shouldn't be controlling anything about the vehicle (but we might want to for example pause operation if we get certain db errors)


## Tasks for Tomorrow
- Clean up states and tasks
- Build out the nav solution inserts to the database
- Test run!

- Add db autostart stuff to proj
- move libpqxx type extention to dao
- clean up schema to make sure we can't insert null where it doesn't make sense (like cleaning)
- ec_cov will need to manage 

- App config

- Replace all boost::make_shared with std::make_shared
- add a bunch of timestamps to the db tables
- refactor gss_ec_coverage to use db values and not the alarms config

libopensea_database ideas
- a class to manage each type of database connection
- abiltiy to load external queries from a sql file, similar to how c# can use sql 'resources', similar to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bbsimonbb.QueryFirst
- libpqxx extensions, at least for strings
- wrappers around other database interface libraries
